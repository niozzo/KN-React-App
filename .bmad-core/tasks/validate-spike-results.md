# Validate Spike Results

## Purpose
Validate spike results against acceptance criteria to ensure the spike achieved its intended objectives.

## Input Parameters
- `spike-name`: Name/identifier of the completed spike

## Prerequisites
- Spike implementation completed
- Spike results documented
- Validation plan available

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Review Spike Results
- **Action**: Analyze completed spike implementation and results
- **Input**: Spike name, implementation results, documentation
- **Output**: Understanding of spike outcomes

### 2. Execute Validation Plan
- **Action**: Execute the defined validation plan
- **Process**:
  - Run test scenarios
  - Validate acceptance criteria
  - Measure success metrics
  - Document validation results
- **Output**: Validation execution results

### 3. Assess Acceptance Criteria
- **Action**: Evaluate each acceptance criterion against results
- **Process**:
  - Compare results to success criteria
  - Identify any gaps or failures
  - Document assessment findings
- **Output**: Acceptance criteria assessment

### 4. Generate Validation Report
- **Action**: Create comprehensive validation report
- **Components**:
  - Validation summary
  - Acceptance criteria results
  - Test execution results
  - Recommendations
  - Next steps
- **Output**: Spike validation report

### 5. Provide Validation Decision
- **Action**: Make final validation decision
- **Options**:
  - PASS: All acceptance criteria met
  - CONCERNS: Some criteria met with concerns
  - FAIL: Acceptance criteria not met
  - WAIVED: Criteria waived with justification
- **Output**: Validation decision and rationale

## Success Criteria
- All acceptance criteria validated
- Validation results documented comprehensively
- Clear validation decision provided
- Recommendations for next steps included

## Error Handling
- If validation fails, document failure reasons and alternatives
- If results are inconclusive, provide analysis and recommendations
- If acceptance criteria are unclear, request clarification

## Notes
- Validation decision should be clear and actionable
- Recommendations should guide next steps
- All findings should be well-documented for future reference
