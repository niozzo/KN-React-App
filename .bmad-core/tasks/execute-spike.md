# Execute Spike

## Purpose
Execute a spike to validate technical decisions and prove key capabilities according to the defined technical approach.

## Input Parameters
- `spike-name`: Name/identifier of the spike

## Prerequisites
- Spike acceptance criteria defined
- Technical approach specified
- Proof points identified

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Review Spike Requirements
- **Action**: Review spike acceptance criteria and technical approach
- **Input**: Spike name, acceptance criteria, technical approach
- **Output**: Clear understanding of spike requirements

### 2. Set Up Development Environment
- **Action**: Prepare development environment for spike work
- **Components**:
  - Technology stack setup
  - Development tools configuration
  - Testing environment preparation
- **Output**: Ready development environment

### 3. Implement Spike
- **Action**: Execute the spike implementation
- **Process**:
  - Follow technical approach
  - Implement proof points
  - Document findings and decisions
  - Test key capabilities
- **Output**: Spike implementation and results

### 4. Validate Proof Points
- **Action**: Validate each identified proof point
- **Process**:
  - Test key capabilities
  - Measure performance benchmarks
  - Validate integration points
  - Document results
- **Output**: Proof point validation results

### 5. Document Spike Results
- **Action**: Create comprehensive spike results document
- **Components**:
  - Implementation details
  - Proof point results
  - Key findings and decisions
  - Recommendations
  - Next steps
- **Output**: Spike results document

## Success Criteria
- Spike implementation completed
- All proof points validated
- Results documented comprehensively
- Clear recommendations provided

## Error Handling
- If implementation fails, document failure reasons and alternatives
- If proof points can't be validated, document limitations and workarounds
- If results are inconclusive, provide analysis and recommendations

## Notes
- This task can be executed by either @Architect (for architecture-focused spikes) or @Dev (for implementation-focused spikes)
- Choose executor based on spike nature and team expertise
