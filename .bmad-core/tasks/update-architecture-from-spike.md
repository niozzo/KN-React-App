# Update Architecture From Spike

## Purpose
Update architecture documentation based on findings and learnings from completed spike work.

## Input Parameters
- `spike-name`: Name/identifier of the completed spike

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Review Spike Results
- **Action**: Analyze spike findings and outcomes
- **Input**: Spike results, findings, and documentation
- **Output**: Understanding of architectural impact

### 2. Identify Architectural Changes
- **Action**: Determine what architectural changes are needed
- **Considerations**:
  - Technology stack decisions
  - Architecture pattern changes
  - Integration approach updates
  - Performance considerations
- **Output**: List of required architectural changes

### 3. Update Architecture Documentation
- **Action**: Modify architecture documents based on spike findings
- **Updates may include**:
  - Technology stack documentation
  - Architecture diagrams
  - Integration specifications
  - Performance requirements
  - Security considerations
- **Output**: Updated architecture documentation

### 4. Update Technical Standards
- **Action**: Revise technical standards based on spike learnings
- **Components**:
  - Coding standards
  - Testing standards
  - Deployment standards
  - Monitoring standards
- **Output**: Updated technical standards

### 5. Validate Architecture Updates
- **Action**: Ensure updated architecture is consistent and complete
- **Validation**:
  - Architecture is internally consistent
  - Technical decisions are well-documented
  - Standards are clear and actionable
  - Integration points are properly specified
- **Output**: Validated architecture updates

## Success Criteria
- Architecture documentation reflects spike findings
- Technical standards are updated appropriately
- All changes are consistent and well-documented
- Architecture remains coherent and actionable

## Error Handling
- If spike results are unclear, request clarification
- If architectural impact is uncertain, consult with team
- If updates create conflicts, resolve with stakeholders
