### üéâ Spike Results

**Status**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFUL**

The TDD infrastructure spike has been successfully completed. We now have a robust, PWA-optimized testing environment that supports:

- **Fast, reliable testing** with Vitest
- **PWA-specific testing capabilities** for Service Workers, offline functionality, and A2HS
- **Comprehensive coverage reporting** with quality gates
- **CI/CD integration** for automated testing
- **Developer-friendly workflow** supporting TDD practices

The foundation is now in place for implementing TDD across all Epic 1 stories and beyond.

## Spike Goal
Research and implement optimal Test-Driven Development (TDD) infrastructure for the Conference Companion PWA using React + Vite + TypeScript + PWA features.

## Time Box
**4 hours** - Research (1 hour) + Implementation (3 hours)

## Research Questions

### Technical Architecture Questions
1. What's the best testing framework for Vite + React + TypeScript?
2. How do we test PWA features (service worker, offline functionality, A2HS)?
3. What's the optimal test structure for our component architecture?
4. How do we integrate testing with our existing CI/CD pipeline?

### Quality Strategy Questions
1. What test coverage thresholds should we establish?
2. How do we test PWA compliance and offline functionality?
3. What are the critical test scenarios for our user stories?
4. How do we ensure test maintainability and developer experience?

### Implementation Questions
1. What testing utilities do we need for PWA testing?
2. How do we mock service workers and PWA APIs?
3. What's the best way to test offline/online state changes?
4. How do we test A2HS (Add to Home Screen) functionality?
