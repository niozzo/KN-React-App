# Application Database Configuration Spike

## Purpose
Determine and configure the application database solution for managing speaker information and agenda item assignments outside of the current Supabase database connection.

## Spike Context
The application currently connects to an external Supabase database for conference data (agenda items, attendees). We need to build an admin page to manage speaker information and assign 0-10 attendees to agenda items. This will be the first case of application data we need to maintain independently.

## Success Criteria

1. **Database Technology Selection**
   - Evaluate and select appropriate database technology for application data storage
   - Consider options: local storage, IndexedDB, SQLite, or separate database instance
   - Document pros/cons of each option for this use case

2. **Data Schema Design**
   - Design schema for speaker information management
   - Design schema for agenda item to attendee assignments (0-10 attendees per item)
   - Ensure schema supports post-login access to local storage of attendees and agenda items

3. **Integration Architecture**
   - Define how application database integrates with existing Supabase data
   - Determine data synchronization approach between external and application databases
   - Plan for data consistency and conflict resolution

4. **Security and Access Control**
   - Define access control for admin page functionality
   - Ensure speaker data is properly secured and only accessible to authorized users
   - Plan for data backup and recovery

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Evaluate performance impact of dual database approach
   - Plan for efficient data retrieval and updates
   - Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Validation Requirements

1. **Technical Validation**
   - Create proof-of-concept implementation of selected database solution
   - Demonstrate basic CRUD operations for speaker and assignment data
   - Test integration with existing Supabase data flow

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Measure query performance for typical admin operations
   - Test data synchronization performance
   - Validate memory usage and storage requirements

3. **Security Validation**
   - Verify access control implementation
   - Test data isolation between users
   - Validate data encryption and security measures

## Acceptance Thresholds

- Database selection must support at least 1000 agenda items with 10 attendees each
- Query response time must be under 200ms for typical admin operations
- Data synchronization must complete within 5 seconds for typical dataset
- Security implementation must pass basic penetration testing
- Solution must be maintainable by current development team

## Deliverables

1. **Technical Recommendation Document**
   - Selected database technology with justification
   - Architecture diagram showing integration approach
   - Implementation timeline and effort estimates

2. **Schema Documentation**
   - Complete database schema for speaker and assignment data
   - Migration scripts if needed
   - Data relationship diagrams

3. **Proof of Concept**
   - Working prototype demonstrating core functionality
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security implementation examples

4. **Implementation Plan**
   - Step-by-step implementation guide
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Rollback procedures

## Timeline
Estimated duration: 3-5 days

## Dependencies
- Access to current Supabase database structure
- Understanding of existing authentication system
- Knowledge of current data transformation layer
