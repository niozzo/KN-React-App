# Story 2.2.3: Admin Force Global Sync

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As an** admin,  
**I want** to force all connected users to immediately refresh their data,  
**so that** critical changes in production are propagated to all attendees instantly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Single "Force Global Sync" button replaces individual "Sync App DB" button
2. Clears all cached data to force fresh fetch from server (PWA cache, application DB, local storage, service worker)
3. Triggers complete data refresh for all connected users using existing sync infrastructure
4. Provides visual feedback during sync process with loading state
5. Handles sync failures gracefully with user notification and retry option
6. Logs all sync operations for audit trail with timestamps
7. Integrates with existing `PWADataSyncService`, `DataInitializationService`, and `AdminService`
8. **TDD**: All force sync components have comprehensive unit tests (80% line coverage)
9. **TDD**: Integration tests for sync operations and user interactions (70% branch coverage)
10. **TDD**: PWA testing for cache clearing and data refresh scenarios
11. **TDD**: Real-time testing for sync propagation and user notifications

## Dev Notes
### Project Context
The force global sync system enables conference administrators to immediately propagate critical data changes to all connected users, ensuring everyone has the latest information without manual refresh. This replaces the need for surgical table-specific sync operations with a comprehensive "refresh everything" approach.

### Technical Requirements
- **Cache Management**: Complete cache clearing across all storage layers
- **Data Refresh**: Force sync of all data from server
- **User Notification**: Visual feedback during sync process
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with retry options
- **Audit Trail**: Logging of all sync operations

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (TDD infrastructure established)
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/components/admin/force-sync/`
- **Coverage**: 80% line, 85% function, 70% branch coverage
- **PWA Testing**: Cache clearing and data refresh scenarios
- **Real-time Testing**: Sync propagation and user notifications validation
- **Integration Testing**: Force sync operations and user interactions
- **Test Pattern**: Given-When-Then for all force sync scenarios

### Implementation Details
- **Button Location**: Admin toolbar, replaces "Sync App DB" button
- **Icon**: Material-UI Sync icon
- **Loading State**: Button shows "Syncing..." with disabled state
- **Confirmation**: Optional confirmation dialog for critical operation
- **Error Display**: Alert component for sync failures
- **Logging**: Console logging with structured format

### Integration Points
- **PWADataSyncService**: `clearCache()` and `forceSync()` methods
- **DataInitializationService**: `forceRefreshData()` method
- **AdminService**: Data reloading after sync
- **Service Worker**: Cache management and update strategies

### Performance Considerations
- **Sync Optimization**: Batch cache clearing operations
- **User Impact**: Minimize UI blocking during sync
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track sync completion times
- **Load Handling**: Support 100+ concurrent users

### Security Considerations
- **Access Control**: Force sync requires admin authentication
- **Data Integrity**: Verify data consistency after sync
- **Audit Trail**: Log all sync operations for security audit
- **User Privacy**: Respect user notification preferences
