# Story 7.3: Post-Conference Content Hub

## User Story
**As a** conference attendee  
**I want** to access a centralized content hub after the conference  
**So that** I can review session recordings, download presentations, access networking contacts, and continue learning from the conference content

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Content Access**: Users can view and download session recordings, slides, and handouts
2. **Networking Hub**: Access to attendee directory with contact information (with privacy controls)
3. **Resource Library**: Organized collection of sponsor materials, whitepapers, and additional resources
4. **Search & Filter**: Ability to search and filter content by session, speaker, topic, or date
5. **Mobile Responsive**: Fully functional on mobile devices for on-the-go access
6. **Offline Access**: Ability to download content for offline viewing
7. **Personal Bookmarks**: Users can save/bookmark their favorite sessions and resources
8. **Feedback System**: Ability to rate sessions and provide feedback for future conferences
9. **TDD**: All content hub components have comprehensive unit tests (80% line coverage)
10. **TDD**: Integration tests for content access, search functionality, and user interactions (70% branch coverage)
11. **TDD**: PWA testing for offline content access and mobile responsiveness
12. **TDD**: Performance testing for content delivery and search optimization

## Priority
**Medium** - Valuable for post-conference engagement but not critical for live event

## Epic
**Epic 7: Conference Information & Support**

## Dependencies
- Session recording system
- User authentication system
- Content management system
- Privacy controls implementation

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (TDD infrastructure established)
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/components/content-hub/`
- **Coverage**: 80% line, 85% function, 70% branch coverage
- **PWA Testing**: Offline content access and mobile responsiveness
- **Performance Testing**: Content delivery and search optimization
- **Integration Testing**: Content access and user interaction flows
- **Test Pattern**: Given-When-Then for all content hub scenarios

## Notes
This story extends the conference value beyond the live event. Should be implemented after the core conference functionality is complete and stable.
