# Story 7.3: Post-Conference Content Hub

## User Story
**As a** conference attendee  
**I want** to access a centralized content hub after the conference  
**So that** I can review session recordings, download presentations, access networking contacts, and continue learning from the conference content

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Content Access**: Users can view and download session recordings, slides, and handouts
2. **Networking Hub**: Access to attendee directory with contact information (with privacy controls)
3. **Resource Library**: Organized collection of sponsor materials, whitepapers, and additional resources
4. **Search & Filter**: Ability to search and filter content by session, speaker, topic, or date
5. **Mobile Responsive**: Fully functional on mobile devices for on-the-go access
6. **Offline Access**: Ability to download content for offline viewing
7. **Personal Bookmarks**: Users can save/bookmark their favorite sessions and resources
8. **Feedback System**: Ability to rate sessions and provide feedback for future conferences

## Technical Requirements
- Secure authentication to verify conference attendance
- Content delivery optimization for video streaming
- Privacy controls for attendee information sharing
- Integration with existing conference app infrastructure
- Analytics tracking for content engagement

## Definition of Done

## Priority
**Medium** - Valuable for post-conference engagement but not critical for live event

## Epic
**Epic 7: Conference Information & Support**

## Dependencies

## Notes
This story extends the conference value beyond the live event. Should be implemented after the core conference functionality is complete and stable.
