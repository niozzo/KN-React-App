# Story 2.1: Now/Next Glance Card

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** attendee,  
**I want** to see my next session with countdown, room, and topic on the home screen,  
**so that** I can quickly know what's happening now and what's next.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Shows next upcoming item based on current time and personal assignments
2. Displays countdown (minutes remaining), room, topic; updates on focus
3. Works offline using cached data; revalidates on network
4. Tapping opens full session detail with quick "Find my seat" if applicable
5. Handles edge cases: between sessions, last session of day, no assignments
6. Shows current session if active (Now card) + next session (Next card)
7. Countdown updates every minute; real-time updates on app focus
8. Integration with admin broadcast countdown timers
