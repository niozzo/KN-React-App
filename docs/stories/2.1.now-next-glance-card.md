# Story 2.1: Now/Next Glance Card

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** attendee,  
**I want** to see my next session with countdown, room, and topic on the home screen,  
**so that** I can quickly know what's happening now and what's next.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Shows next upcoming item based on current time and personal assignments
2. Displays countdown (minutes remaining), room, topic; updates on focus
3. Works offline using cached data; revalidates on network
4. Tapping opens full session detail with quick "Find my seat" if applicable
5. Handles edge cases: between sessions, last session of day, no assignments
6. Shows current session if active (Now card) + next session (Next card)
7. Countdown updates every minute; real-time updates on app focus
8. Integration with admin broadcast countdown timers
9. **Smart Countdown Logic**: Meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee breaks) only show countdown when in "Now" status; all other sessions show time range in top-right corner
10. **Consistent Time Placement**: Time information always appears in top-right corner of both Now and Next cards
11. **Countdown as Status Text**: When meals are in "Now" status, countdown replaces the "Now" text in the status badge
12. **Prominent Now Card Styling**: Light purple background, top border, and shadow to distinguish current session
13. **Simplified Navigation**: Single "View Full Schedule" CTA replaces redundant quick action cards

## Dev Notes
### Project Context
The Now/Next glance card is the primary value proposition of the Conference Companion PWA. It provides C-level executives with instant access to their current and next sessions with minimal taps.

### Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or polling
- **Offline Support**: Service worker caching
- **Performance**: < 1.0s update time on app focus

### Data Requirements
- Current time and session data
- User assignments and preferences
- Session details (title, room, time, topic)
- Seat assignments when applicable
- Admin broadcast messages

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Design**: Clean, professional, glanceable
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Smooth animations and transitions
- **Offline**: Clear offline indicators

### UX Design Notes
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Now card uses light purple background, top border, and shadow for prominence
- **Information Architecture**: Time consistently placed in top-right corner for predictable scanning
- **Smart Countdowns**: Only meals/breaks in "Now" status show countdown; others show time range
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Single schedule CTA instead of multiple quick action cards
- **Consistent Styling**: No left borders on any cards; clean, minimal design approach
- **Status Integration**: Countdown replaces "Now" text when applicable for cleaner layout
- **Layout Consistency**: Must match schedule page layout exactly - status (left) and time (right) in same line
- **Seat Visibility**: White background for seat info in current session cards for better contrast
- **Content Positioning**: Title, location, speaker details in consistent positions across both pages

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/components/`
- **Coverage**: All card states and interactions
- **Performance Testing**: Update timing and responsiveness
- **Offline Testing**: Network failure scenarios

### Key Considerations
- Countdown accuracy and performance
- Offline data availability
- Real-time update efficiency
- User experience during edge cases
- Integration with other app features
