# Story 2.2: Personalized Schedule View

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** attendee,  
**I want** to view my combined schedule (general + breakouts + dinner + seat assignments),  
**so that** I have a complete view of my conference experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Combines general agenda with identity-linked assignments from Supabase
2. Indicates assigned seat/table; supports dynamic timing updates from admin
3. **Simple agenda view** - No filtering controls; clean, straightforward schedule display
4. **Card-based layout** - Sessions grouped under day headers as cohesive visual units
5. **Consistent content positioning** - Status (left) and time (right) in header; title, location, speaker details below
6. **Day header design** - Purple headers that attach to session cards below (rounded top, flat bottom)
7. **Seat visibility** - White background for seat info in current session cards for better contrast
8. **Progressive disclosure** for seat maps and details
