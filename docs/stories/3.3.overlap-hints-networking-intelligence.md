# Story 3.3: Overlap Hints & Networking Intelligence

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** attendee,  
**I want** to see overlap opportunities with people on my meet list,  
**so that** I can identify the best times to connect.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Shows overlap hints: shared sessions, dinner table, break windows
2. Displays overlap information in attendee profiles
3. Contextual hints in meet list view
4. Integration with schedule and seat assignments
5. Clear indication when no overlaps exist
6. **TDD**: All overlap detection and intelligence components have comprehensive unit tests (80% line coverage)
7. **TDD**: Integration tests for overlap calculations, profile display, and user interactions (70% branch coverage)
8. **TDD**: PWA offline functionality testing for overlap data persistence
9. **TDD**: Performance testing for overlap calculations with large attendee lists

## Dev Notes
### Project Context
Overlap hints provide intelligent networking suggestions by identifying when attendees have opportunities to meet based on shared sessions, dinner tables, and break times.

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (TDD infrastructure established)
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/components/overlap/`
- **Coverage**: 80% line, 85% function, 70% branch coverage
- **PWA Testing**: Offline overlap data persistence and synchronization
- **Performance Testing**: Overlap calculations with large attendee lists
- **Integration Testing**: Overlap detection and display functionality
- **Test Pattern**: Given-When-Then for all overlap intelligence scenarios
