## Dev Notes
### Project Context
This story enhances the existing sign-out functionality in Epic 1 to ensure complete data clearing and proper navigation. The current sign-out implementation in `authService.ts` only clears basic authentication state, but doesn't clear all the cached data that gets downloaded during the authentication process.

### Technical Requirements
- **Data Clearing**: Clear all locally cached data including authentication state, attendee info, and PWA cache
- **Navigation**: Redirect to login page after successful sign-out
- **User Experience**: Provide loading state and feedback during sign-out process
- **Error Handling**: Handle cache clearing failures gracefully
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure functionality works across all supported browsers and devices

### Existing System Integration
- **Integrates with**: AuthContext, SettingsPage, authService, attendeeInfoService, pwaDataSyncService
- **Technology**: React, TypeScript, localStorage, PWA caching
- **Follows pattern**: Existing authentication and data management patterns
- **Touch points**: SettingsPage sign-out button, AuthContext logout method, data clearing services

### Data Clearing Requirements
The sign-out process must clear the following cached data:
- `conference_auth` - Authentication state from localStorage
- `kn_current_attendee_info` - Attendee information cache
- All `kn_cache_*` keys - PWA cached data (attendees, sponsors, agenda, etc.)
- **IndexedDB data** - PWA data storage (attendees, sponsors, agenda, etc.)
- **Service worker caches** - All cached assets and data
- Any other locally stored conference data

### Enhanced Technical Implementation
The logout method should be implemented as an async function with proper error handling:

```typescript
const logout = async (): Promise<{ success: boolean; error?: string }> => {
  try {
    // 1. Clear localStorage data
    await clearLocalStorageData()
    
    // 2. Clear IndexedDB data
    await clearIndexedDBData()
    
    // 3. Clear service worker caches
    await clearServiceWorkerCaches()
    
    // 4. Update auth state
    setIsAuthenticated(false)
    setAttendee(null)
    
    // 5. Navigate to login
    navigate('/login')
    
    return { success: true }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors gracefully
    return { success: false, error: error.message }
  }
}
```

### User Experience Considerations
- Clear visual feedback during sign-out process
- Loading indicator while data is being cleared
- Success confirmation before redirect to login
- Graceful error handling if data clearing fails
- Consistent experience across all devices and browsers

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (TDD infrastructure established)
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/auth/` and `src/__tests__/services/`
- **Coverage**: 80% line, 85% function, 70% branch coverage
- **Integration Testing**: Complete sign-out flow with data clearing
- **PWA Testing**: Cache clearing functionality and offline state
- **Test Pattern**: Given-When-Then for all sign-out scenarios

### Enhanced Test Scenarios
Additional test scenarios based on QA recommendations:

```gherkin
# Performance Testing
Given a user has large amounts of cached data (>100MB)
When the user clicks sign-out
Then the operation should complete within 5 seconds
And memory usage should return to baseline levels

# Error Recovery Testing
Given a user attempts sign-out during network failure
When cache clearing fails partially
Then the user should see appropriate error message
And partial data should still be cleared where possible
And user should be able to retry sign-out

# Security Testing
Given a user is signed in with sensitive data
When the user clicks sign-out
Then no sensitive data should remain in browser storage
And all authentication tokens should be invalidated
And the user should be redirected to login page

# Cross-Browser Testing
Given a user is on Safari/Chrome/Firefox/Edge
When the user clicks sign-out
Then all data should be cleared consistently
And navigation should work properly
And no browser-specific errors should occur
```

### Key Considerations
- Data clearing must be comprehensive to protect user privacy
- Sign-out process should be fast and responsive (≤5 seconds)
- Error handling must not leave user in inconsistent state
- Navigation must work reliably across all supported platforms
- Cache clearing should not interfere with PWA functionality
- **IndexedDB clearing** is critical for PWA data storage
- **Service worker cache clearing** ensures complete data removal
- **Async operations** must be properly handled with race condition protection
- **Performance monitoring** needed for large dataset scenarios
- **Cross-browser compatibility** testing is essential
