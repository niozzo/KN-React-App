## Dev Notes
### Project Context
This is the foundation story for the Conference Companion PWA. The application needs to be installable on mobile devices and work offline to serve C-level executives at conferences.

### Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite (recommended for PWA development)
- **PWA Features**: Manifest, Service Worker, Offline caching
- **Target Devices**: Primarily iOS (iPhone) with Android support
- **Performance**: Fast loading and offline capability

### File Structure
```
src/
├── manifest.json
├── sw.js (service worker)
├── components/
├── pages/
├── utils/
└── assets/
    └── icons/
```

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/` or `tests/`
- **PWA Testing**: Use Lighthouse for PWA audits
- **Offline Testing**: Test with network throttling
- **A2HS Testing**: Test on actual mobile devices

### Key Considerations
- Ensure manifest meets PWA criteria
- Service worker must handle offline scenarios gracefully
- A2HS prompt timing is critical for user adoption
- Performance is key for executive users
