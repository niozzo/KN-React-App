# Story 1.1: Project Setup & PWA Foundation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to establish the basic PWA project structure with manifest, service worker, and offline caching,  
**so that** the application can be installed and work offline from day one.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PWA manifest configured with proper icons, theme colors, and display mode
2. Service worker implemented with offline caching strategy
3. Basic offline page and error handling
4. A2HS (Add to Home Screen) functionality working
5. Project structure follows established patterns and includes CI/CD pipeline

## Dev Notes
### Project Context
This is the foundation story for the Conference Companion PWA. The application needs to be installable on mobile devices and work offline to serve C-level executives at conferences.

### Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite (recommended for PWA development)
- **PWA Features**: Manifest, Service Worker, Offline caching
- **Target Devices**: Primarily iOS (iPhone) with Android support
- **Performance**: Fast loading and offline capability

### File Structure
```
src/
├── manifest.json
├── sw.js (service worker)
├── components/
├── pages/
├── utils/
└── assets/
    └── icons/
```

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/` or `tests/`
- **PWA Testing**: Use Lighthouse for PWA audits
- **Offline Testing**: Test with network throttling
- **A2HS Testing**: Test on actual mobile devices

### Key Considerations
- Ensure manifest meets PWA criteria
- Service worker must handle offline scenarios gracefully
- A2HS prompt timing is critical for user adoption
- Performance is key for executive users
