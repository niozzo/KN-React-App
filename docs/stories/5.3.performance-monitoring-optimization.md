# Story 5.3: Performance Monitoring & Optimization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** performance monitoring and optimization,  
**so that** the app meets all performance requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. First contentful paint < 1.5s on 3G, < 1.0s on WiFi
2. Now/Next update < 1.0s on app resume
3. Battery efficiency monitoring
4. Offline functionality validation
5. Performance regression testing
6. **TDD**: All performance monitoring components have comprehensive unit tests (80% line coverage)
7. **TDD**: Integration tests for performance metrics collection and optimization (70% branch coverage)
8. **TDD**: PWA testing for performance monitoring and offline functionality
9. **TDD**: Performance testing for regression detection and optimization validation
