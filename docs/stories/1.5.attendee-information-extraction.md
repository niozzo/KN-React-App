# Story 1.5: Attendee Information Extraction & Easy Access ✅ COMPLETED

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - PO Validated

## Story
**As a** logged-in attendee,  
**I want** my first name and last name to be easily accessible throughout the application,  
**so that** the app can personalize my experience and display my information without repeatedly querying the database.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Authentication system, server data sync service, and attendee data management
- Technology: React + TypeScript + Material Design components
- Follows pattern: Server-side data extraction before sanitization, cached data access patterns
- Touch points: AuthContext login flow, ServerDataSyncService.lookupAttendeeByAccessCode(), attendee data sanitization

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Server-Side Extraction**: Attendee information (first name, last name, full name, email, company, title) is extracted from full attendee data before sanitization during the authentication process
2. **Separate Cache Storage**: Extracted attendee information is stored in a separate cache key (`kn_current_attendee_info`) for easy access
3. **Easy Access Methods**: The application provides simple methods to access attendee name information (first name, last name, full name) throughout the app
4. **AuthContext Integration**: The AuthContext provides `attendeeName` state for easy access to name information
5. **React Hook Support**: A `useAttendeeInfo` hook provides convenient access to attendee information in React components

**Integration Requirements:**

6. **Server Data Sync Integration**: The extraction integrates with `ServerDataSyncService.lookupAttendeeByAccessCode()` to capture data before sanitization
7. **Existing Authentication Flow**: The extraction works seamlessly with the existing hybrid authentication process
8. **Cache Management**: The attendee info cache is properly managed with expiration (24 hours) and cleanup on logout
9. **Type Safety**: All attendee information access is fully typed with TypeScript interfaces

**Quality Requirements:**

10. **Security**: Access codes and other sensitive information are never stored in the attendee info cache
11. **Performance**: Attendee name information is available immediately after login without additional database queries
12. **Error Handling**: The system gracefully handles extraction failures without breaking authentication
13. **Cache Validation**: The system validates cache data and handles expiration appropriately

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Authentication Flow**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Main authentication context with hybrid login process
- **Server Data Sync**: `src/services/serverDataSyncService.ts` - Server-side data synchronization with admin authentication
- **Attendee Types**: `src/types/attendee.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for attendee data
- **Data Sanitization**: `src/types/attendee.ts` - `sanitizeAttendeeForStorage()` function removes access_code
- **PWA Data Sync**: `src/services/pwaDataSyncService.ts` - PWA data synchronization patterns

### Key Technical Context
- **Hybrid Authentication**: The system uses admin authentication to bypass RLS, then validates attendee access codes
- **Data Sanitization**: Attendee data is sanitized before caching to remove sensitive information like access_code
- **Cache Strategy**: Data is cached in localStorage with `kn_cache_` prefix for PWA offline functionality
- **Server-Side Extraction**: Information must be extracted before sanitization to preserve access to sensitive data
- **Type Safety**: All attendee data access is fully typed with TypeScript interfaces

### Integration Points
- **AuthContext.login()**: Calls `serverDataSyncService.lookupAttendeeByAccessCode()` for authentication
- **ServerDataSyncService**: Uses admin credentials to access full attendee data before sanitization
- **Attendee Data Flow**: Full data → Extract info → Sanitize data → Cache sanitized data + separate info cache
- **React Context**: Provides `attendeeName` state for easy access throughout the app

### Testing Standards
- **Test File Location**: `src/__tests__/` directory following existing patterns
- **Test Standards**: Use Vitest + React Testing Library for component tests
- **Testing Frameworks**: Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- **Specific Requirements**: Test attendee info extraction, cache management, and hook functionality
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete authentication flow with attendee info extraction
