## Technical Approach

### System-Level Analysis
- **Configuration Deep Dive**: Analyze `vite.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, and `package.json` for process management settings
- **Process Tree Analysis**: Use system tools to identify parent-child process relationships
- **Resource Handle Audit**: Check for unclosed file handles, network connections, and timers
- **Event Loop Analysis**: Examine Node.js event loop for blocking operations

### Technology Stack Investigation
- **Vite Build System**: Analyze Vite's internal process management and cleanup procedures
- **Vitest Test Runner**: Review test runner lifecycle and server management
- **Node.js Process Management**: Investigate process exit handling and signal management
- **System Dependencies**: Check for external processes or services keeping handles open

### Architecture Patterns to Test
- **Process Isolation**: Test different process isolation strategies
- **Cleanup Patterns**: Implement and test various cleanup patterns
- **Signal Handling**: Test proper SIGTERM/SIGINT handling
- **Resource Management**: Test proper resource cleanup on exit

### Implementation Plan

   - Enable hanging-process reporter
   - Run tests with process monitoring
   - Document hanging behavior patterns

3. **Resource Audit**
   - Check for unclosed handles
   - Identify blocking operations
   - Document resource usage patterns

#### Phase 2: Solution Development (2-4 hours)
1. **Configuration Optimization**
   - Implement optimal Vite/Vitest settings
   - Add proper cleanup procedures
   - Configure process management

2. **Process Management**
   - Implement proper signal handling
   - Add resource cleanup procedures
   - Configure process isolation

3. **Testing Framework**

### Success Metrics
- **Exit Time**: Server exits within 5 seconds of test completion
- **Resource Cleanup**: No hanging handles or processes
- **Reliability**: 100% clean exit rate across 10+ test runs
- **Performance**: No significant performance degradation

## QA Validation Plan

### Validation Strategy
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test across multiple scenarios and environments
- **Automated Validation**: Implement automated checks for hanging processes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor resource usage and exit times
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure solution doesn't break existing functionality

### Test Scenarios

#### Positive Test Cases
1. **Clean Exit Validation**
   - **Given**: Tests complete successfully
   - **When**: Vite server should exit
   - **Then**: Server exits within 5 seconds, no hanging processes

2. **Resource Cleanup Validation**
   - **Given**: Tests run with various configurations
   - **When**: Server exits
   - **Then**: All handles, timers, and connections are properly closed

3. **Multiple Test Run Validation**
   - **Given**: Running tests multiple times
   - **When**: Each test run completes
   - **Then**: Server exits cleanly every time (100% success rate)

#### Negative Test Cases
1. **Hanging Process Detection**
   - **Given**: Current hanging behavior exists
   - **When**: Tests complete
   - **Then**: Hanging processes are identified and documented

2. **Configuration Impact Testing**
   - **Given**: Different Vite/Vitest configurations
   - **When**: Tests run
   - **Then**: Impact on hanging behavior is documented

#### Edge Cases
1. **Interrupted Test Runs**
   - **Given**: Tests are interrupted mid-execution
   - **When**: Server should exit
   - **Then**: Server exits cleanly despite interruption

2. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - **Given**: System under high load
   - **When**: Tests run
   - **Then**: Server still exits cleanly

### Validation Criteria

#### Root Cause Identification
- **Method**: Process monitoring and analysis
- **Success**: Specific cause identified and documented
- **Failure**: Unable to identify root cause
- **Measurement**: Documentation of exact hanging processes

#### Solution Effectiveness
- **Method**: Automated testing and monitoring
- **Success**: 100% clean exit rate across 10+ test runs
