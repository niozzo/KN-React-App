# Story 1.2: Supabase Integration & Schema Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to establish Supabase connection and define the core database schema,  
**so that** all subsequent features have a reliable data foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Supabase project configured with proper RLS policies
2. Core tables created: attendees, sessions, breakouts, dinners, seats, assignments
3. Authentication tables and user management setup
4. Database connection and basic CRUD operations working
5. Environment configuration for development/production
6. **TDD**: All database operations have comprehensive unit tests (80% line coverage)
7. **TDD**: Integration tests for CRUD operations and data validation (70% branch coverage)
8. **TDD**: PWA offline functionality tested for data synchronization
9. **TDD**: Authentication flow testing with proper mocking

## Dev Notes
### Project Context
This story establishes the data foundation for the Conference Companion PWA. Supabase will serve as the source of truth for all conference data including attendees, sessions, and user assignments.

### Database Schema Design
**Core Tables:**
- `attendees`: User profiles and contact information
- `sessions`: Conference sessions and events
- `breakouts`: Breakout session details
- `dinners`: Meal events and seating
- `seats`: Venue seating arrangements
- `assignments`: User-to-session/seat assignments

### Technical Requirements
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **RLS**: Row Level Security for data protection
- **Client**: Supabase JavaScript client
- **Environment**: Development and production configurations

### Security Considerations
- RLS policies must be properly configured
- User data must be protected
- Authentication must be secure
- Environment variables must be properly managed

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (TDD infrastructure established)
- **Database Testing**: Use Supabase test environment with proper mocking
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/database/`
- **Coverage**: 80% line, 85% function, 70% branch coverage
- **PWA Testing**: Offline/online data synchronization testing
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end data flow validation
- **Test Pattern**: Given-When-Then for all test scenarios

### Key Considerations
- Schema must support all epic requirements
- RLS policies must be comprehensive
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Backup and recovery procedures
