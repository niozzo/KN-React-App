## Dev Notes
### Project Context
This story establishes the data foundation for the Conference Companion PWA. Supabase will serve as the source of truth for all conference data including attendees, sessions, and user assignments.

### Database Schema Design
**Core Tables:**
- `attendees`: User profiles and contact information
- `sessions`: Conference sessions and events
- `breakouts`: Breakout session details
- `dinners`: Meal events and seating
- `seats`: Venue seating arrangements
- `assignments`: User-to-session/seat assignments

### Technical Requirements
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **RLS**: Row Level Security for data protection
- **Client**: Supabase JavaScript client
- **Environment**: Development and production configurations

### Security Considerations
- RLS policies must be properly configured
- User data must be protected
- Authentication must be secure
- Environment variables must be properly managed

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Jest for unit tests
- **Database Testing**: Use Supabase test environment
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/database/`
- **Coverage**: All CRUD operations and RLS policies

### Key Considerations
- Schema must support all epic requirements
- RLS policies must be comprehensive
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Backup and recovery procedures
