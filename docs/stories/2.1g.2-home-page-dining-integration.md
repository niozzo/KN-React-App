#### **Test Strategy Enhancements**

**1. Enhanced Animation Testing (AC: 3)**
```typescript
// Given-When-Then Animation Test Scenarios
describe('AnimatedNowNextCards Dining Integration', () => {
  describe('Given dining event is current session', () => {
    it('When transitioning to dining event, Then animation is smooth', () => {
      // Test dining event animation
    });
    
    it('When dining event ends, Then next event animates properly', () => {
      // Test dining-to-session transition
    });
  });
  
  describe('Given dining event is next session', () => {
    it('When current session ends, Then dining event slides up', () => {
      // Test session-to-dining transition
    });
  });
});
```

**2. Responsive Design Testing (AC: 7)**
- Mobile (320px-768px): Dining card layout and touch interactions
- Tablet (768px-1024px): Dining card scaling and animations
- Desktop (1024px+): Full dining card functionality
- Orientation changes: Dining card reflow and repositioning

**3. Visual Consistency Testing**
- Dining icons match design system standards
- Color schemes consistent with existing cards
- Typography and spacing match session cards
- Animation timing consistent with existing patterns

**4. Integration Testing Scenarios**
- Dining events in now/next logic
- Mixed session and dining event transitions
- Time-based filtering with dining events
- Error handling for dining event display

#### **Non-Functional Requirements Validation**
- **Performance**: <100ms animation frame rate maintained
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for dining cards
- **Responsive**: Seamless experience across all device sizes
- **Visual**: Consistent design language with existing components

#### **Test Coverage Targets**
- **Line Coverage**: 85% (increased from 80%)
- **Branch Coverage**: 75% (increased from 70%)
- **Function Coverage**: 90% (increased from 85%)

#### **Critical Test Cases**
1. **Animation Transitions**: Dining events in now/next animations
2. **Responsive Layout**: Dining cards across all screen sizes
3. **Visual Consistency**: Dining cards match session card design
4. **Time Filtering**: Dining events properly filtered by time
5. **Error Handling**: Dining event display failures

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Animation Performance**: Monitor frame rates during dining transitions
2. **Visual Regression**: Implement screenshot testing for dining cards
3. **Touch Testing**: Validate touch interactions on mobile devices
