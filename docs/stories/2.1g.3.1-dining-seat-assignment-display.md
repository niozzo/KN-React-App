# Story 2.1g.3.1: Dining Seat Assignment Display

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** attendee,  
**I want** to see my table and seat assignment for dining events with assigned seating,  
**so that** I know where to sit when I arrive at the venue.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Seat Assignment Display**: Show "Your Seat: Table X • Seat Y" for dining events with `seating_type: "assigned"` when attendee has a seat assignment
2. **Open Seating Display**: Show "Open seating" indicator for dining events with `seating_type: "open"` (already implemented)
3. **No Assignment Display**: Show appropriate message when dining event has assigned seating but attendee has no seat assignment
4. **Consistent Display**: Seat assignment information displays consistently on both Home Page (Now/Next cards) and Schedule Page
5. **Interactive Elements**: Clicking seat assignment navigates to seat map with focus on attendee's table
6. **Visual Consistency**: Dining seat assignments use same styling as agenda item seat assignments
7. **Data Integration**: Query and cache dining seat assignments along with regular seat assignments
8. **TDD**: All seat assignment display logic has comprehensive unit tests (80% line coverage)
9. **TDD**: Integration tests for seat assignment data loading and display (70% branch coverage)

## Dev Notes
### Project Context
This story completes the incomplete implementation from Story 2.1g.3 (SessionCard Dining Support). While Story 2.1g.3 had acceptance criteria and tasks for displaying dining seat assignments, the actual implementation skipped dining events in the seat enhancement logic.

**Current Issue**: 
- Line 536-539 of `src/hooks/useSessionData.js` explicitly returns dining events WITHOUT seat info enhancement
- This causes dining events with `seating_type: "assigned"` to show NO seat information
- Open seating works correctly (shows "Open seating" box)

### Technical Requirements
- **Data Source**: Dining seat assignments (need to identify table/structure)
- **Enhancement Logic**: Extend `enhanceEventWithSeatInfo()` to handle dining events
- **Display Component**: SessionCard already has seat assignment rendering
- **Navigation**: Reuse existing seat map navigation logic
- **Caching**: Store dining seat assignments in localStorage

### Key Implementation Areas

**1. Data Layer** (`src/services/dataService.ts`):
```typescript
// Update getAttendeeSeatAssignments() to include dining assignments
export const getAttendeeSeatAssignments = async (): Promise<SeatAssignment[]> => {
  // Current: Only fetches agenda item seat assignments
  // Update: Also fetch dining seat assignments
  // Return: Combined array of both types
}
```

**2. Hook Enhancement** (`src/hooks/useSessionData.js`):
```javascript
const enhanceEventWithSeatInfo = (event) => {
  if (!event || !seatAssignments.length) return event || null;
  
  // REMOVE THIS CHECK - allow dining events to be enhanced
  // if (event.type === 'dining') {
  //   return event;
  // }
  
  // Find seat assignment for this event (session OR dining)
  const seatAssignment = seatAssignments.find(seat => {
    if (event.type === 'dining') {
      // Match dining events by dining_option_id or similar
      return seat.dining_option_id === event.id;
    } else {
      // Match agenda items by seating_configuration_id
      return seat.seating_configuration_id === event.seating_configuration_id;
    }
  });
  
  return {
    ...event,
    seatInfo: seatAssignment ? {
      table: seatAssignment.table_name,
      seat: seatAssignment.seat_number,
      position: seatAssignment.seat_position
    } : null
  };
};
```

**3. Display Logic** (`src/components/session/SessionCard.jsx`):
```javascript
// Lines 397-443 already handle seatInfo display
// No changes needed - will automatically work once seatInfo is populated
{seatInfo && (
  <div className="seat-assignment" onClick={handleSeatMapClick}>
    <div className="seat-label">Your Seat</div>
    <div className="seat-details">
      <span>{seatInfo.table} • Seat {seatInfo.seat}</span>
      <span className="seat-map-link">Find my seat</span>
    </div>
  </div>
)}

// Add: Handle assigned seating with no assignment
{isDiningEventSession && session.seating_type === 'assigned' && !seatInfo && (
  <div className="seat-assignment" style={{ cursor: 'default' }}>
    <span>Seat assignment pending</span>
  </div>
)}
```

### Data Structure Investigation
Need to determine:
1. **Table name**: Where are dining seat assignments stored? (e.g., `dining_seat_assignments`, `seat_assignments` with type field)
2. **Key fields**: `dining_option_id`, `attendee_id`, `table_name`, `seat_number`
3. **Join logic**: How to match dining events to seat assignments

### Dependencies
- Story 2.1g.3 (SessionCard Dining Support) - COMPLETED but incomplete
- Story 2.3 (Seat Map Viewer) - Handles seat map navigation
- Existing seat assignment infrastructure

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/components/SessionCard-dining-seats.test.tsx`
- **Coverage**: 80% line, 85% function, 70% branch coverage
- **Integration Testing**: Seat assignment data loading and display
- **Unit Testing**: Seat info enhancement logic
- **Navigation Testing**: Seat map navigation for dining events
