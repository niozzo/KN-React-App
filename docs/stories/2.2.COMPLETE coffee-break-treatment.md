# Story 2.2: Coffee Break Treatment

## Status
**DONE** - 6 out of 6 Tasks Complete (100% Done)  
**COMPLETED** - 2025-01-16 - All coffee break treatment functionality implemented and tested
**PRIORITY** - High - Special treatment for coffee breaks as shown in mockups

## Story
**As an** attendee,  
**I want** coffee breaks to have special countdown treatment when they're the current session,  
**so that** I can see exactly how much time is left in the coffee break with a prominent countdown timer.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Coffee Break Detection**: System identifies coffee breaks as meal-type sessions containing "Coffee Break" in the title
2. **Special Countdown Treatment**: Coffee breaks in "Now" status show countdown timer in the time area (no status badge)
3. **Dynamic Update Intervals**: Countdown updates every minute until 5 minutes left, then updates every second
4. **Visual Distinction**: Coffee break cards have enhanced purple styling (no coffee icon per requirements)
5. **Real-time Updates**: Countdown updates dynamically based on time remaining and on app focus
6. **Consistent Behavior**: Coffee break treatment works across all components (HomePage, SchedulePage, etc.)
7. **Edge Case Handling**: Proper handling when coffee break ends and transitions to next session
8. **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage for coffee break detection and countdown logic
9. **Documentation**: Updated architecture docs to reflect coffee break special treatment

## Dev Notes
### Project Context
Coffee breaks are a special case in the conference schedule that require enhanced countdown treatment. Unlike regular sessions, coffee breaks need prominent countdown timers to help attendees manage their break time effectively.

### Current Implementation Status
- **Basic Detection**: ✅ Partial - System can detect coffee breaks via title matching
- **Countdown Logic**: ✅ Partial - Basic countdown exists but needs enhancement
- **Visual Treatment**: ❌ Missing - No special styling for coffee breaks
- **Consistency**: ❌ Missing - Not implemented across all components

### Technical Requirements
- **Detection Logic**: Enhanced coffee break detection for meal-type sessions
- **Countdown Priority**: Coffee breaks get countdown treatment in "Now" status
- **Visual Design**: Special styling matching mockup specifications
- **Real-time Updates**: Minute-by-minute countdown updates
- **Cross-component**: Consistent behavior across all session display components

### Data Requirements
- Session type: `meal` for coffee breaks
- Title matching: Contains "Coffee Break" phrase
- Time data: Start and end times for countdown calculation
- Status: Current session ("Now") vs upcoming ("Next")

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Countdown Display**: Prominent countdown timer instead of "NOW" text
- **Visual Distinction**: Enhanced styling to highlight coffee break status
- **Consistent Layout**: Maintains existing card layout and structure
- **Real-time Updates**: Smooth countdown updates every minute
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels for countdown timers

### Mockup Analysis
Based on the mockup in `mockups/home.html`:
- Coffee break shows "23 minutes left" in the status area
- Time range "10:00 AM - 10:30 AM" in top-right corner
- Special styling with light purple background
- Clean, minimal design with countdown as primary status indicator

### Key Considerations
- Coffee break detection must be robust for various title formats
- Countdown accuracy is critical for time management
- Visual treatment should be subtle but noticeable
- Performance impact of enhanced countdown logic
- Consistency across all session display components
- Edge cases when coffee break transitions to next session
