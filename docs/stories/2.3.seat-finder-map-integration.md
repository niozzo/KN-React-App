## Dev Notes

Simple seat map viewer that shows attendees where their assigned table is located within a specific venue/room. Each table has its own pre-highlighted map image, eliminating the need for code-based highlighting. Displays location name for context with a clean, map app-style interface.

### Technical Requirements
- **Map Technology**: Pre-highlighted static images per table
- **Image Naming**: `<locationName>_<tableNumber>` format (e.g., `GrandBallroomA_12.jpg`)
- **File Formats**: Support for jpg, png, and other standard image formats
- **Interaction**: Basic pinch/zoom and pan functionality
- **Simplicity**: Minimal UI, focus on map viewing
- **Performance**: Fast loading, smooth interactions
