# Story 8.3: Visual Regression Testing for UI Changes

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** automated visual regression testing to catch unintended UI changes,  
**so that** the user interface remains consistent and functional across all updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Visual regression testing framework integrated (e.g., Percy, Chromatic, or Playwright Visual)
2. Automated screenshot comparison for all major UI components
3. Baseline images captured for all supported viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
4. Integration with CI/CD pipeline to run on every PR
5. Visual diff reporting with clear pass/fail indicators
6. Support for dynamic content and responsive design testing
7. Ability to update baselines when intentional changes are made
8. Coverage of critical user flows and edge cases
9. Performance impact monitoring to ensure tests don't slow down builds
10. Clear documentation for developers on how to handle visual test failures

  - [ ] Identify all major UI components and pages
  - [ ] Capture baseline images for mobile viewport (375px)
  - [ ] Capture baseline images for tablet viewport (768px)
  - [ ] Capture baseline images for desktop viewport (1200px+)
- [ ] Implement responsive design testing (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Test components at different breakpoints
  - [ ] Handle dynamic content and animations
  - [ ] Test dark/light mode variations if applicable
- [ ] Set up visual diff reporting (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Configure clear pass/fail indicators
  - [ ] Set up notification system for failures
  - [ ] Create visual diff review process
- [ ] Cover critical user flows (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Test main navigation flows
  - [ ] Test form interactions and validations

  - [ ] Test loading states and transitions
- [ ] Implement baseline update process (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Create process for updating baselines when changes are intentional
  - [ ] Document approval workflow for baseline updates
  - [ ] Train team on baseline update procedures
- [ ] Monitor performance impact (AC: 9)
  - [ ] Measure build time impact
  - [ ] Optimize test execution speed
  - [ ] Set up performance monitoring

  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - [ ] Document process for handling test failures
  - [ ] Create best practices guide

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Test files should be located in `src/__tests__/visual/` directory
- Use Playwright for visual testing as it integrates well with existing test setup
- Follow existing testing patterns established in the project
- Visual tests should run in headless mode for CI/CD
- Use consistent naming convention: `{component}.visual.test.tsx`

### Relevant Architecture Information
- Project uses React with TypeScript
- Existing test setup uses Vitest and Playwright
- Material Design UI framework is used throughout the application
- PWA with offline capabilities requires testing of cached states
- Responsive design breakpoints: mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1200px+)

### Key Components to Test
- Now/Next glance cards
- Schedule views and components
- Attendee search and discovery
- Meet list management
- Admin broadcast system
- Settings and configuration pages
- Navigation and routing
- Error states and loading indicators

### Technical Considerations
- Handle dynamic content like timestamps and user-specific data
- Test both online and offline states for PWA functionality
- Ensure tests work with different authentication states
- Consider accessibility testing integration
- Plan for cross-browser compatibility testing
