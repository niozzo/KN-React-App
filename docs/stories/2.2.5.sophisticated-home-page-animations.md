# Story 2.2.5: Sophisticated Home Page Animations

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** attendee,  
**I want** the home page to smoothly transition between different conference states with sophisticated animations,  
**so that** I have a polished, professional experience that clearly communicates the current conference phase and upcoming changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Before Conference State
1. **Label Transformation**: "Scheduled start..." label smoothly transforms into "Now" label with fade transition
2. **Next Card Promotion**: Next card smoothly slides down from its position to become the Now card
3. **Content Push**: All content below the promoted card smoothly slides down to accommodate the new layout
4. **Timing Coordination**: All animations are perfectly synchronized and complete within 800ms
5. **Visual Continuity**: No jarring jumps or layout shifts during transitions

### During Conference State  
6. **Now Card Fade**: Current Now card smoothly fades out with opacity transition
7. **Next Card Slide Up**: Next card smoothly slides up to fill the Now card position
8. **Label Transformation**: Next card's label smoothly transforms to "Now" during the slide
9. **New Next Card Fade In**: A new Next card fades in from below to fill the Next position
10. **Seamless Transition**: All animations flow together as a single cohesive sequence

### End of Conference State
11. **End Card Display**: Special "End of Conference" card appears if designed, otherwise graceful handling
12. **No New Cards**: System handles the absence of additional cards to slide in
13. **Final State**: Clean, professional end state without broken animations or empty spaces
14. **Consistent Behavior**: End state follows same animation principles as other states

### Technical Requirements
15. **Performance**: All animations maintain 60fps on mobile devices
16. **Accessibility**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` user preference
17. **Data Safety**: Animations never interfere with data loading or state updates
18. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if animation system fails
19. **State Management**: Proper React state coordination during complex animations
20. **Memory Management**: No memory leaks from animation timers or event listeners

### Quality Assurance
21. **TDD**: All animation components have comprehensive unit tests (80% line coverage)
22. **TDD**: Integration tests for state transitions and animation sequences (70% branch coverage)
23. **TDD**: Performance tests for animation smoothness and timing accuracy
24. **TDD**: Accessibility tests for reduced motion preferences
25. **TDD**: Error handling tests for animation failure scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story builds on the existing Now/Next card functionality (Story 2.1) to add sophisticated animations that enhance the user experience during different conference phases. The animations must be professional, smooth, and never interfere with data integrity.

### Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Animation Library**: Custom CSS animations with React coordination
- **Performance**: 60fps on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with reduced motion support
- **State Management**: React Context for animation state coordination
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for animation failures

### Animation Design Principles
- **Purposeful Motion**: Every animation serves a functional purpose
- **Professional Restraint**: Subtle, refined animations for executive context
- **Performance First**: Optimized for mobile devices and battery life
- **Accessibility Respect**: Honor reduced motion preferences
- **Data Safety**: Never compromise data integrity for visual effects

### Key Animation Sequences

#### Before Conference Transition
1. **Label Update**: "Scheduled start..." → "Now" (fade transition, 300ms)
2. **Card Promotion**: Next card slides down to Now position (slide + scale, 500ms)
3. **Content Adjustment**: All content below slides down (slide, 400ms)
4. **Timing**: All animations start simultaneously, complete within 800ms

#### During Conference Transition
1. **Now Fade**: Current Now card fades out (opacity, 400ms)
2. **Next Slide**: Next card slides up to Now position (slide + scale, 500ms)
3. **Label Transform**: Next label transforms to Now (fade, 300ms)
4. **New Next**: New Next card fades in from below (fade + slide, 400ms)
5. **Timing**: Sequential with 100ms overlap for smooth flow

#### End of Conference Transition
1. **End Card**: Special end card appears (fade + slide, 500ms)
2. **No New Cards**: System handles empty state gracefully
3. **Final State**: Clean, professional end state

### Data Safety Requirements
- **State Isolation**: Animation state never interferes with data state
- **Error Boundaries**: Animation failures don't break data functionality
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to disable animations if needed
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of animation resources

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual animation components and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Complete animation sequences and state transitions
- **Performance Tests**: 60fps maintenance and timing accuracy
- **Accessibility Tests**: Reduced motion preference handling
- **Error Tests**: Animation failure scenarios and recovery
- **Visual Tests**: Animation smoothness and visual quality
