#### **Test Strategy Enhancements**

**1. Enhanced Accessibility Testing (AC: 7)**
```typescript
// Given-When-Then Accessibility Test Scenarios
describe('SessionCard Dining Accessibility', () => {
  describe('Given dining event is displayed', () => {
    it('When screen reader navigates, Then dining info is announced', () => {
      // Test ARIA labels for dining events
    });
    
    it('When keyboard navigation is used, Then dining card is focusable', () => {
      // Test keyboard navigation
    });
  });
  
  describe('Given dining event has seat assignments', () => {
    it('When seat info is displayed, Then it is accessible', () => {
      // Test seat assignment accessibility
    });
  });
});
```

**2. Variant Testing (AC: 6)**
- **Now Variant**: Dining events as current sessions
- **Next Variant**: Dining events as upcoming sessions
- **Agenda Variant**: Dining events in schedule view
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same interactions across all variants

**3. Layout Consistency Testing**
- Dining cards match session card dimensions
- Text wrapping for dining information
- Spacing and padding consistency
- Responsive behavior across variants

**4. Interactive Elements Testing**
- Seat assignment click handlers
- Dining event detail expansion
- Navigation between dining events
- Action button functionality

#### **Non-Functional Requirements Validation**
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all dining cards
- **Performance**: <50ms rendering time for dining cards
- **Consistency**: Identical behavior across all variants
- **Usability**: Intuitive interactions for dining events

#### **Test Coverage Targets**

- **Branch Coverage**: 75% (increased from 70%)
- **Function Coverage**: 90% (increased from 85%)

#### **Critical Test Cases**
1. **Accessibility Compliance**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
2. **Variant Consistency**: Behavior across now/next/agenda variants
3. **Layout Integrity**: Dining cards match session card design
4. **Interactive Elements**: Dining-specific interactions work properly
5. **Error Handling**: Dining event display failures

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Accessibility Testing**: Use automated and manual testing tools
2. **Variant Testing**: Comprehensive testing across all card variants
3. **Visual Regression**: Screenshot testing for dining card layouts
4. **User Testing**: Validate dining card usability with real users
