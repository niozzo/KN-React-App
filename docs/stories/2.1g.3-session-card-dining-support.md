## Dev Notes
### Project Context
This story extends the existing SessionCard component to support dining events, ensuring consistent display and interaction patterns across all event types in the application.

### Technical Requirements
- **Component**: Extend existing `SessionCard` component
- **Data Source**: Dining events from enhanced data layer
- **Performance**: Maintain existing card rendering performance
- **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Key Features
- Dining event support in SessionCard
- Dining-specific visual indicators
- Consistent layout and positioning
- Dining-specific interactions
- Full variant support (now, next, agenda)

### Dependencies
- Story 2.1g.1 (Dining Options Data Integration)
- Story 2.1g.2 (Home Page Now/Next Dining Integration)
- Existing `SessionCard` component
- Story 2.2 (Personalized Schedule View) - will inherit dining support

### UX Design Requirements
- **Visual Consistency**: Dining cards match existing session card design
- **Information Hierarchy**: Clear display of dining-specific information
- **Interactive Elements**: Intuitive dining event interactions
- **Accessibility**: Full accessibility compliance
- **Responsive**: Proper scaling across all device sizes

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/components/SessionCard-dining.test.tsx`
- **Coverage**: 80% line, 85% function, 70% branch coverage
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
- **Variant Testing**: All card variants with dining events
- **Integration Testing**: Dining card interactions and data flow

## QA Results

### **Quality Gate: PASS** ✅
**Review Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)

#### **Requirements Traceability: EXCELLENT**
- ✅ All acceptance criteria map to specific test scenarios
- ✅ Accessibility requirements clearly defined
- ✅ Variant support requirements properly specified

#### **Risk Assessment: MEDIUM**
- **Accessibility Risk**: MEDIUM - Dining-specific ARIA labels and navigation
- **Variant Risk**: MEDIUM - Consistent behavior across all card variants
- **Layout Risk**: LOW - Well-defined layout consistency requirements
- **Performance Risk**: LOW - Minimal impact on existing card rendering

#### **Test Strategy Enhancements**

**1. Enhanced Accessibility Testing (AC: 7)**
```typescript
// Given-When-Then Accessibility Test Scenarios
describe('SessionCard Dining Accessibility', () => {
  describe('Given dining event is displayed', () => {
    it('When screen reader navigates, Then dining info is announced', () => {
      // Test ARIA labels for dining events
    });
    
    it('When keyboard navigation is used, Then dining card is focusable', () => {
      // Test keyboard navigation
    });
  });
  
  describe('Given dining event has seat assignments', () => {
    it('When seat info is displayed, Then it is accessible', () => {
      // Test seat assignment accessibility
    });
  });
});
```

**2. Variant Testing (AC: 6)**
- **Now Variant**: Dining events as current sessions
- **Next Variant**: Dining events as upcoming sessions
- **Agenda Variant**: Dining events in schedule view
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same interactions across all variants

**3. Layout Consistency Testing**
- Dining cards match session card dimensions
- Text wrapping for dining information
- Spacing and padding consistency
- Responsive behavior across variants

**4. Interactive Elements Testing**
- Seat assignment click handlers
- Dining event detail expansion
- Navigation between dining events
- Action button functionality

#### **Non-Functional Requirements Validation**
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all dining cards
- **Performance**: <50ms rendering time for dining cards
- **Consistency**: Identical behavior across all variants
- **Usability**: Intuitive interactions for dining events

#### **Test Coverage Targets**
- **Line Coverage**: 85% (increased from 80%)
- **Branch Coverage**: 75% (increased from 70%)
- **Function Coverage**: 90% (increased from 85%)

#### **Critical Test Cases**
1. **Accessibility Compliance**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
2. **Variant Consistency**: Behavior across now/next/agenda variants
3. **Layout Integrity**: Dining cards match session card design
4. **Interactive Elements**: Dining-specific interactions work properly
5. **Error Handling**: Dining event display failures

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Accessibility Testing**: Use automated and manual testing tools
2. **Variant Testing**: Comprehensive testing across all card variants
3. **Visual Regression**: Screenshot testing for dining card layouts
4. **User Testing**: Validate dining card usability with real users
