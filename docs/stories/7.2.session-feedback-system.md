# Story 7.2: Session Feedback System

## User Story
**As a** conference attendee  
**I want** to provide feedback on each session I attend  
**So that** organizers can improve future events and I can help other attendees make informed choices

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Quick Rating**: 1-5 star rating system for each session
2. **Written Feedback**: Optional text field for detailed comments
3. **Session Identification**: Clear identification of which session is being rated
4. **Anonymous Option**: Choice to provide feedback anonymously
5. **Feedback History**: View of previously submitted feedback
6. **Real-time Submission**: Feedback submitted immediately when entered
7. **Confirmation**: Clear confirmation that feedback was received
8. **Session Context**: Access to session information while providing feedback
9. **TDD**: All feedback system components have comprehensive unit tests (80% line coverage)
10. **TDD**: Integration tests for feedback submission, real-time sync, and user interactions (70% branch coverage)
11. **TDD**: PWA testing for offline feedback capability and real-time synchronization
12. **TDD**: Performance testing for feedback submission and data synchronization

## Technical Requirements
- Real-time data synchronization
- Offline capability with sync when connected
- Integration with session tracking system
- Analytics dashboard for organizers
- Privacy controls for anonymous feedback

## Definition of Done
- [ ] 1-5 star rating system is functional
- [ ] Text feedback field is available and working
- [ ] Session identification is clear and accurate
- [ ] Anonymous feedback option is implemented
- [ ] Feedback history is accessible to users
- [ ] Real-time submission works correctly
- [ ] Confirmation messages are displayed
- [ ] Schedule context is available during feedback
- [ ] Offline sync functionality is tested
- [ ] Analytics dashboard is operational for organizers

## Priority
**Medium** - Important for conference improvement but not critical for basic functionality

## Epic
**Epic 7: Conference Information & Support**

## Dependencies
- Session tracking system
- User authentication system

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (TDD infrastructure established)
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/components/feedback/`
- **Coverage**: 80% line, 85% function, 70% branch coverage
- **PWA Testing**: Offline feedback capability and real-time synchronization
- **Performance Testing**: Feedback submission and data synchronization optimization
- **Integration Testing**: Feedback submission and user interaction flows
- **Test Pattern**: Given-When-Then for all feedback system scenarios

## Notes
This story enables continuous improvement of the conference experience. Should be implemented after basic session functionality is complete.
