# Story 3.2: Meet List Management

## Status
UI Shell Complete - Data Integration Pending

## Story
**As an** attendee,  
**I want** to build and manage a private list of people to meet,  
**so that** I can organize my networking goals.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add/remove attendees to/from private meet list
2. Tabbed interface: "All Attendees" and "My Meet List"
3. No sharing by default; completely private
4. Integration with attendee search and discovery
5. **NEW**: Presenter names link to bio pages from home and schedule pages
6. **NEW**: Business card animation when adding to meet list
7. **NEW**: Dynamic counter updates with visual feedback
8. **NEW**: Button state changes to "✓ In my meet list" tag
9. **NEW**: Sticky tab navigation for seamless access
10. **NEW**: Enhanced visual feedback with tab flash effects
11. **TDD**: All meet list management components have comprehensive unit tests (80% line coverage)
12. **TDD**: Integration tests for meet list operations, tab navigation, and user interactions (70% branch coverage)
13. **TDD**: PWA offline functionality testing for meet list persistence
14. **TDD**: Animation and visual feedback testing for business card effects

## Dev Notes
### Project Context
Meet list management allows attendees to create and manage a private list of people they want to meet, facilitating networking goals.

### Current Implementation Status
- **UI Shell:** ✅ Complete - React components built with mock data and animations
- **Data Integration:** ⏳ Pending - Will be implemented during story execution
- **Current State:** Components display mock attendee data with working animations, ready for real data connection

### Mockup References
- **Primary Mockup**: `mockups/meet.html`
- **Tab Navigation**: Lines 735-739 (Sticky tab navigation with "All Attendees" and "My Meet List")
- **Business Card Animation**: Lines 1164-1203 (JavaScript animation system)
- **Button State Management**: Lines 1201-1205 (Button transformation to tag)
- **Counter Updates**: Lines 1206-1212 (Dynamic counter with pulse animation)
- **Tab Flash Effect**: CSS classes `.tab-flash` and `@keyframes tabFlash` for visual feedback
- **Attendee Cards**: Lines 825-870 (Individual attendee cards with action buttons)

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (TDD infrastructure established)
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/components/meetlist/`
- **Coverage**: 80% line, 85% function, 70% branch coverage
- **PWA Testing**: Offline meet list persistence and data synchronization
- **Animation Testing**: Business card effects and visual feedback validation
- **Integration Testing**: Meet list operations and tab navigation flows
- **Test Pattern**: Given-When-Then for all meet list management scenarios
