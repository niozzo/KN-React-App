# Story 8.2: Authentication System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** attendee,  
**I want** to sign in securely with minimal friction using email OTP,  
**so that** I can access personalized conference information when authentication is required for sensitive operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Email OTP/magic link authentication implemented
2. Optional SMS OTP when phone number is available
3. Session persistence and secure token storage
4. Rate limiting on OTP sends (max 3 attempts per 15 minutes)
5. Sign-out flows and session management
6. Privacy consent banner for discoverability and notifications
7. Account recovery flow for locked accounts
8. Integration with Supabase Auth for user management
9. **TDD**: All authentication flows have comprehensive unit tests (80% line coverage)
10. **TDD**: Integration tests for OTP generation, validation, and session management (70% branch coverage)
11. **TDD**: PWA offline authentication state testing and token persistence
12. **TDD**: Security testing for rate limiting, token validation, and session handling

## Dev Notes
### Project Context
Authentication is implemented as a separate epic (Epic 8) that will only be needed if we ever allow users to perform sensitive operations that require secure access control. This keeps the core application simple and accessible while providing security when needed for sensitive features.

### Technical Requirements
- **Authentication Provider**: Supabase Auth
- **OTP Methods**: Email and SMS
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with refresh
- **Rate Limiting**: 3 attempts per 15 minutes
- **Security**: HTTPS, secure storage, rate limiting

### User Experience Considerations
- Minimal friction for busy executives
- Clear error messages and feedback
- Privacy controls prominently displayed
- Account recovery options
- Mobile-optimized interface

### Security Requirements
- Rate limiting on OTP requests
- Secure token storage
- Session timeout handling
- Privacy consent management
- Account lockout protection

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (TDD infrastructure established)
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/auth/`
- **Coverage**: 80% line, 85% function, 70% branch coverage
- **Security Testing**: Rate limiting, token validation, session handling
- **PWA Testing**: Offline authentication state and token persistence
- **Integration Testing**: Supabase Auth integration with proper mocking
- **Test Pattern**: Given-When-Then for all authentication scenarios

### Key Considerations
- OTP delivery reliability
- User experience during authentication
- Privacy compliance (GDPR)
- Mobile device compatibility
- Offline authentication handling
