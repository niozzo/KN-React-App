# Story 4.2: Schedule Management & Real-time Updates

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** admin,  
**I want** to update session times and rooms,  
**so that** attendees receive real-time schedule changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Schedule manager interface for updating session times/rooms
2. Triggers client refresh for all connected users
3. Audit trail of last broadcast and schedule sync timestamps
4. Integration with Now/Next cards for immediate updates
5. Graceful handling of schedule conflicts
6. Bulk update capabilities for multiple sessions
7. **TDD**: All schedule management components have comprehensive unit tests (80% line coverage)
8. **TDD**: Integration tests for schedule updates, real-time sync, and user interactions (70% branch coverage)
9. **TDD**: PWA testing for real-time updates and offline schedule management
10. **TDD**: Real-time testing for schedule synchronization and conflict resolution
