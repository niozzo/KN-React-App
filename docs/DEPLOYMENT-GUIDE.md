# Deployment Guide (Solo Developer Edition)

## Branch Strategy

### Branches
- **`main`** - Production (protected, PR required)
- **`develop`** - Staging/Preview (unprotected, direct commits OK)
- **`feature/*`** - Feature development (optional)

### Protection Rules

#### Main Branch (Production) - PROTECTED
- ‚úÖ Require pull request before merging
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
- ‚ùå No approvals required (solo dev)
- ‚úÖ Cannot bypass settings
- üéØ **Purpose:** Your safety net - forces review before production

#### Develop Branch (Staging) - UNPROTECTED
- ‚úÖ Direct commits allowed
- ‚úÖ CI runs automatically on every commit
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploys to staging via Vercel
- üéØ **Purpose:** Fast iteration and testing

## Daily Workflow

### Recommended: Direct Development on Develop Branch
```bash
# 1. Switch to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Commit and push to staging
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin develop
# ‚úÖ CI runs automatically
# ‚úÖ Auto-deploys to staging
# ‚úÖ No PR needed

# 4. Test on staging environment
# Visit your staging URL and verify everything works

# 5. Deploy to production when ready
# Go to GitHub and create PR: develop ‚Üí main
# Review the diff carefully (this is your safety check!)
# After CI passes, merge the PR
# ‚úÖ Auto-deploys to production
```

### Optional: Using Feature Branches
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch (if you want a preview URL)
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
# ‚úÖ Creates unique preview URL on Vercel

# 3. Merge to staging (no PR needed)
git checkout develop
git merge feature/my-feature
git push origin develop
# ‚úÖ Deploys to staging

# 4. Clean up
git branch -d feature/my-feature
git push origin --delete feature/my-feature

# 5. Deploy to production via PR
# Create PR: develop ‚Üí main on GitHub
```

## Vercel Configuration

### Environment Setup (Single Database)

**Current Setup:** Using the same Supabase database for all environments

**Production (main branch):**
- Domain: `your-app.vercel.app`
- Environment Variables: Same as staging (shared database)

**Staging (develop branch):**
- Domain: `develop-your-app.vercel.app`
- Environment Variables: Same as production (shared database)

**Preview (feature branches):**
- Domain: Auto-generated preview URLs
- Environment Variables: Same as production/staging (shared database)

### Shared Environment Variables

All branches use the same Supabase database:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` ‚Üí Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ‚Üí Your Supabase anon key

**Note:** These should be configured for **all environments** (Production, Preview, Development) in Vercel

### Deployment Settings in Vercel Dashboard

1. **Production Branch:** Set to `main`
2. **Git Integration:**
   - Enable automatic deployments from Git
   - Enable comments on PRs
   - Enable deployment protection (optional)

3. **Environment Variables (Single Database Setup):**
   - All environments (Production, Preview, Development) use the same values
   - Simplifies configuration
   - Both staging and production access the same Supabase database

## GitHub Settings

### Branch Protection Rules

**For `main`:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable:
   - ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require approvals (1)
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
   - ‚úÖ Do not allow bypassing the above settings

**For `develop`:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule
2. Branch name pattern: `develop`
3. Enable:
   - ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging

## Environment Variables

### Single Database Setup (Current)

All environments (staging and production) use the **same Supabase database**:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

**Where to set:**
- **Vercel:** Set for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
- **Local:** Use `.env.local` for local development (optional, or use same values)

### Local Development (Optional - `.env.local`)
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Future: Separate Databases (Optional)

If you later want separate staging/production databases:

**Staging:**
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://staging-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-staging-anon-key
```

**Production:**
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://prod-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-prod-anon-key
```

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Before Pushing to Develop (Staging)
- [ ] All tests pass locally (`npm run test`)
- [ ] Application builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Feature tested locally
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Committed with clear message

### Before Merging to Main (Production)
- [ ] Feature tested on staging environment
- [ ] All tests pass on CI
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Database migrations completed (if any)
- [ ] Performance tested
- [ ] Mobile/responsive tested
- [ ] PWA features working
- [ ] Offline functionality verified
- [ ] Final stakeholder approval

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (Vercel Dashboard)
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Find last working deployment
3. Click "..." ‚Üí "Promote to Production"

### Git Rollback
```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git checkout main
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

### Emergency Hotfix
```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix

# Make fix and test
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical issue"

# Push and create PR to main (expedited review)
git push -u origin hotfix/critical-fix

# After deployment, merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/critical-fix
git push origin develop
```

## Monitoring

### Post-Deployment Verification
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify application loads correctly
3. Test critical user flows
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify API connections (Supabase)
6. Test PWA installation
7. Monitor error tracking (if configured)

### Regular Monitoring
- Vercel Analytics Dashboard
- Supabase Dashboard (API usage, errors)
- Browser DevTools (Console, Network)
- User feedback channels

## Using Vercel CLI (Alternative Method)

### When to Use CLI
- Prefer command-line workflow
- Troubleshooting auto-deploy issues
- Manual control over deployments
- Initial setup of branches in Vercel

### Installation
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
```

### Deploy Commands
```bash
# Preview/Staging deployment
git checkout develop
vercel

# Production deployment
git checkout main
vercel --prod

# Force new deployment (skip cache)
vercel --force

# Deploy specific branch
git checkout feature/my-feature
vercel
```

### Initial Branch Setup
If Git auto-deploy isn't working, establish branches manually:
```bash
# Establish main as production
git checkout main
vercel --prod --yes

# Establish develop as preview
git checkout develop
vercel --yes
```

After this one-time setup, Git auto-deploy should work normally.

## Common Issues

### Auto-Deploy Not Working
**Symptom:** Pushing to Git doesn't trigger Vercel deployment

**Solutions:**
1. Check Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Git ‚Üí GitHub integration is enabled
2. Establish branches using CLI (see "Initial Branch Setup" above)
3. Check if branch is configured in Settings ‚Üí Git

### Build Failures
- Check Node version matches `engines` in `package.json`
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Check for TypeScript errors

### Environment Variable Issues
- Ensure variables prefixed with `VITE_` for client-side access
- Remember to redeploy after changing env vars
- With single database setup, ensure variables are set for all environments

### Cache Issues
- Clear Vercel build cache in dashboard
- Update service worker version
- Force refresh in browser (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Use `vercel --force` to skip cache

## Database Setup Notes

### Current: Single Supabase Database

You're using **one Supabase database** for all environments:
- ‚úÖ Simpler setup and management
- ‚úÖ No need to sync schemas between databases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful: staging changes affect production data
- üí° Best for: Development, testing, small projects

### Best Practices:
1. **Test thoroughly** on staging before deploying to production
2. **Use RLS policies** to protect sensitive data
3. **Backup regularly** using Supabase's backup features
4. **Consider separate databases** when:
   - You have significant production traffic
   - You need to test with fake data
   - You want to avoid any risk to production data
