### BMAD Flow Principles

#### 1. Progressive Decomposition
```
High-Level Goal → Feature → Epics → Stories → Tasks
```

#### 2. Business Value Focus
- Each epic has a **clear business mission**
- Each story delivers **measurable business value**
- **Acceptance criteria** tied to business outcomes

#### 3. Incremental Delivery
- **Complete epics** before moving to next
- **Validate business value** at each story completion
- **Deploy incrementally** as epics are ready

### Example Flow for "Advanced Receipt Processing"

```
@PO *discover "Need better receipt processing for large volumes"
@PM *prd "Advanced Receipt Processing"
@PO *epic-breakdown "Advanced Receipt Processing"
├── @PO *epic-plan "Batch Processing"
├── @PO *epic-plan "OCR Enhancement"  
└── @PO *epic-plan "Performance Optimization"

@PO *story-breakdown "Batch Processing"
├── @PO *story-breakdown "Process 100 receipts simultaneously"
├── @PO *story-breakdown "Progress tracking and error handling"
└── @PO *story-breakdown "Batch validation and reporting"
```

### Key Benefits of This Flow

1. **Strategic to Tactical** - Goes from business goal to implementation
2. **Manageable Chunks** - Breaks complexity into digestible pieces
3. **Clear Handoffs** - Each role knows exactly when to engage
4. **Business Validation** - Ensures value delivery at each level
5. **Risk Management** - Identifies issues early in the process
