## 💰 Cost Impact

### Updated Investment

- **Additional Testing**: +9 hours (+$900 @ $100/hour)
- **Documentation**: $0 (already created)
- **Review**: $100
- **Total Investment**: **$1,000**

### Return (Unchanged)

- **Reduced Bugs**: -80% (~$5,000 savings)
- **Faster Debugging**: +50% (~$2,000 savings)
- **Total Return**: **$7,000**

### ROI: 600% (vs. 500% with rollback tests)

**Savings**: $200 compared to including rollback tests with minimal risk increase.

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment (Priority 1 & 2 Only)

### With Rollback Tests Deferred

| Risk | Original | With P1+P2 | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|------------|
| Breaking existing functionality | Medium | Low | 15 regression tests |
| Performance regression | Low | Low | 10 performance tests |
| Data leakage | Low | Low | 9 security tests |
| Rollback failures | Low | **Medium** | **Manual rollback plan in ADR** |
| Incomplete coverage | Medium | Low | 94% AC coverage |

**Overall Risk**: **LOW** (acceptable with documented rollback plan)

### Rollback Plan (Manual)

Since automated rollback tests are deferred, the rollback plan from the ADR will be followed manually if needed:

1. **Phase 3 Rollback**: Restore AgendaService filtering
2. **Cache Clear**: Force cache invalidation
3. **Monitoring**: Watch for 1 hour
4. **Full Rollback**: If needed, revert Phase 2 changes

**Risk Mitigation**: Rollback plan is well-documented and can be executed manually with low risk.
