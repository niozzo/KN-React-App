# Test Strategy Validation

  atomic_scenarios: true

# Quality Gates
quality_gates:
  unit_test_gate:
    requirement: "All P0 unit tests must pass, â‰¥80% code coverage"
    status: "DEFINED"
  
  integration_test_gate:
    requirement: "All P0 integration tests must pass, database operations verified"
    status: "DEFINED"
  
  e2e_test_gate:
    requirement: "All P0 E2E tests must pass, critical user journeys validated"
    status: "DEFINED"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  - "Implement using TDD approach - Write tests first, then implement features"
  - "Start with P0 tests - Focus on security and data validation first"
  - "Use test data management - Automated cleanup and isolated test environments"
  - "Performance testing - Ensure 2-second load time requirement is met"

# Test Data Requirements
test_data:
  agenda_items: "5-10 items with various titles"
  attendees: "20-30 attendees with diverse names"
  assignments: "Mix of 0-10 assignments per item"
  edge_cases: "Empty titles, special characters, long names"

# Test Environment Requirements
test_environment:
  unit_tests: "Jest/Vitest framework, mocked database services"
  integration_tests: "Test database instance, mocked external services"
  e2e_tests: "Playwright/Cypress framework, full application environment"

# Performance Requirements
performance:
  page_load_time: "< 2 seconds"
  unit_test_time: "< 1 second each"
  integration_test_time: "< 5 seconds each"
  e2e_test_time: "< 30 seconds each"

# Security Considerations
security:
  passcode_validation: "Hardcoded passcode '616161' validation"
  authentication_flow: "Existing authentication integration"
  data_isolation: "Application database separate from external data"
  input_validation: "Comprehensive validation for all inputs"

# Dependencies
dependencies:
  blocking: "Application Database Configuration Spike (2.1a-spike) must be completed"
  required: "Existing authentication system"
  required: "Local storage containing attendees and agenda items data"

# Next Steps
next_steps:
  - "Complete Application Database Configuration Spike"
  - "Set up test environment and test data"
  - "Begin development using TDD approach"
  - "Implement P0 tests first, then P1 and P2"
  - "Validate against quality gates at each milestone"

# Gate Decision Rationale
gate_decision_rationale: |
  Story 2.1a has comprehensive test coverage across all acceptance criteria with appropriate 
  test levels and priorities. The test strategy addresses all identified risks and provides 
  clear quality gates for development. The story is ready for development with a robust 
  testing foundation that will ensure quality and reduce risk during implementation.
