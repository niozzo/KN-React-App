# Story 8.2: Admin Broadcast System

## Story Overview
**Story 8.2** implements a complete admin broadcast system with UI for creating, managing, and displaying broadcast messages to conference attendees.

## Story Status
**PLANNING** - Deferred from Story 2.1 for proper implementation

## Background
During Story 2.1 implementation, broadcast functionality was identified as requiring a separate, comprehensive implementation with proper Admin UI rather than being included as a basic feature.

## User Stories

### As an Admin
- I want to create broadcast messages with different priority levels (normal, high, critical)
- I want to set expiration times for broadcast messages
- I want to preview how broadcast messages will appear to attendees
- I want to manage active broadcast messages (edit, delete, extend)
- I want to see analytics on broadcast message engagement

### As a Conference Attendee
- I want to see important broadcast messages prominently displayed
- I want to dismiss broadcast messages I've already read
- I want broadcast messages to automatically expire when they're no longer relevant
- I want to see countdown timers for time-sensitive broadcasts

## Acceptance Criteria

### Admin UI Requirements
- [ ] **Admin Dashboard**: Create admin interface for broadcast management
- [ ] **Message Creation**: Form to create new broadcast messages with:
  - Message text (required)
  - Priority level (normal, high, critical)
  - Expiration time (optional)
  - Preview functionality
- [ ] **Message Management**: List of active broadcasts with:
  - Edit functionality
  - Delete functionality
  - Extend expiration option
  - Status indicators
- [ ] **Analytics**: Basic analytics on broadcast engagement

### Attendee UI Requirements
- [ ] **Broadcast Display**: Prominent display of active broadcasts
- [ ] **Priority Styling**: Visual distinction between priority levels
- [ ] **Dismissal**: Ability to dismiss broadcasts
- [ ] **Countdown**: Timer display for expiring broadcasts
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **API Integration**: Real API endpoints for broadcast CRUD operations
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Live updates when broadcasts are created/modified
- [ ] **localStorage Persistence**: Cache broadcasts for offline viewing
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures
- [ ] **Performance**: Efficient rendering and updates

## Technical Implementation

### Components to Build
1. **AdminBroadcastManager**: Admin interface for managing broadcasts
2. **BroadcastCreator**: Form for creating new broadcasts
3. **BroadcastList**: List of active broadcasts with management options
4. **AdminBroadcastBanner**: Enhanced attendee-facing broadcast display
5. **BroadcastAnalytics**: Basic analytics dashboard

### API Endpoints Required
- `GET /api/broadcasts` - List all broadcasts
- `POST /api/broadcasts` - Create new broadcast
- `PUT /api/broadcasts/:id` - Update broadcast
- `DELETE /api/broadcasts/:id` - Delete broadcast
- `GET /api/broadcasts/analytics` - Get broadcast analytics

### Data Model
```typescript
interface Broadcast {
  id: string;
  message: string;
  priority: 'normal' | 'high' | 'critical';
  type: 'info' | 'warning' | 'urgent';
  expiresAt: Date | null;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  createdBy: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  dismissals: number; // Analytics
  views: number; // Analytics
}
```

## Dependencies
- **Backend API**: Broadcast endpoints must be implemented
- **Admin Authentication**: Admin users need proper authentication
- **Real-time System**: WebSocket or polling for live updates

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: All components and services
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: API integration and real-time updates
- [ ] **E2E Tests**: Complete admin workflow
- [ ] **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Large number of broadcasts

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Admin can create, edit, and delete broadcast messages
- [ ] Attendees see broadcasts prominently with proper styling
- [ ] Real-time updates work correctly
- [ ] All tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Priority
**Medium** - Enhancement feature for improved conference management

## Estimated Effort
**8-12 story points** - Complex feature with admin UI, real-time updates, and analytics

## Notes
- This story was deferred from Story 2.1 to ensure proper implementation
- Requires backend API development
- Should be implemented after core conference functionality is stable
- Consider implementing in phases (basic functionality first, analytics later)
