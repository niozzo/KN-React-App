   - State transitions with detailed context
   - Visibility changes with sync decisions
   - Performance metrics collection

2. **Data Privacy & Security**
   - Automatic sanitization of sensitive data
   - Environment-appropriate log levels
   - Secure session ID generation

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Cache hit/miss ratio tracking
   - Response time measurement
   - Operation count statistics
   - Average response time calculation

4. **Error Detection & Handling**
   - Future timestamp detection
   - Cache corruption identification
   - Graceful error handling
   - Detailed error context logging
