# Legacy Architecture Documents

This directory contains database-related documents that were consolidated into the main `database-schema.md` document.

## Consolidated Documents

### `data-tables-understanding-assessment.md`
- **Purpose**: Table analysis and implementation readiness assessment
- **Consolidated into**: `database-schema.md` (Implementation Status section)
- **Reason**: Redundant with main schema document

### `database-analysis.json`
- **Purpose**: Raw database analysis data
- **Consolidated into**: `database-schema.md` (verified schema data)
- **Reason**: Raw data replaced with verified, structured schema

### `database-structure-reference.md`
- **Purpose**: Detailed table structures and column information
- **Consolidated into**: `database-schema.md` (Core Application Tables section)
- **Reason**: Duplicate information with better organization

### `entity-relationships-analysis.md`
- **Purpose**: ER diagrams and relationship analysis
- **Consolidated into**: `database-schema.md` (Entity Relationships section)
- **Reason**: Relationships now included in main schema document

### `final-data-model-clarification.md`
- **Purpose**: Simplified data model for application
- **Consolidated into**: `database-schema.md` (TypeScript interfaces)
- **Reason**: Data model now part of authoritative schema

### `ui-driven-schema-analysis.md`
- **Purpose**: Schema derived from UI form analysis
- **Consolidated into**: `database-schema.md` (verified against actual database)
- **Reason**: UI analysis was preliminary; actual schema is now verified

## Why Consolidation Was Needed

1. **Redundancy**: Multiple documents covering the same information
2. **Inconsistency**: Different field names and structures across documents
3. **Maintenance burden**: Updates needed in multiple places
4. **Confusion**: Developers didn't know which document to trust
5. **BMAD best practice**: Single source of truth for schema

## Current State

- **Single authoritative document**: `database-schema.md`
- **All information preserved**: Nothing was lost in consolidation
- **Better organization**: Clear sections for different aspects
- **Verified data**: All schema information confirmed against actual database
- **TypeScript interfaces**: Ready-to-use type definitions

## Usage

- **For development**: Use `database-schema.md` as the single source of truth
- **For historical reference**: These legacy documents are preserved
- **For understanding evolution**: These documents show how our understanding evolved

## Migration Notes

All information from these documents has been:
- ✅ Verified against actual database schema
- ✅ Consolidated into logical sections
- ✅ Updated with correct field names and types
- ✅ Organized for easy reference
- ✅ Made consistent across all sections
