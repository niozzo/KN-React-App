# Frontend Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan to transform the current mockup HTML files into a clean, maintainable React application architecture while preserving the exact visual design and user experience.

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified
1. **Massive Code Duplication**: 400-1400+ lines per file with repeated CSS and HTML
2. **Poor Component Architecture**: Monolithic files with mixed concerns
3. **Inconsistent Styling**: Hardcoded values and varying patterns
4. **JavaScript Architecture Issues**: Inline handlers and no module system

### Code Duplication Examples
- Design tokens repeated in every file (lines 10-43)
- Header component duplicated across all pages
- Bottom navigation recreated in each file
- Common button and card styles repeated

## Refactoring Strategy

The refactoring follows a systematic approach to transform monolithic HTML mockup files into a clean, maintainable React component architecture while preserving exact visual fidelity. The strategy focuses on:

1. **Foundation**: Design system, component library, and file structure
2. **Component Migration**: Reusable components and state management
3. **Animation System**: Consistent animations and transitions
4. **Documentation**: Update existing docs and create new guides
5. **Integration**: React Router, data fetching, and error handling
6. **Testing**: Component testing and performance optimization

See the **Implementation Checklist** below for detailed progress tracking.

## Component Architecture

### Design System
```
src/styles/
├── design-tokens.css    # Single source of truth for all design values
├── components.css       # Reusable component styles
└── utilities.css        # Utility classes and helpers
```

### Component Library
```
src/components/
├── common/              # Shared UI components
│   ├── Header.jsx
│   ├── BottomNav.jsx
│   ├── Button.jsx
│   ├── Card.jsx
│   └── StatusTag.jsx
├── session/             # Session-specific components
│   ├── SessionCard.jsx
│   └── SessionList.jsx
├── attendee/            # Attendee-specific components
│   ├── AttendeeCard.jsx
│   └── AttendeeList.jsx
└── layout/              # Layout components
    ├── PageLayout.jsx
    └── Section.jsx
```

### Hooks System
```
src/hooks/
├── useMeetList.js       # Meet list state and animations
├── useSearch.js         # Search and filtering
├── useSort.js           # List sorting
└── useSharedEvents.js   # Expandable event details
```

## Migration Examples

### Before: Monolithic HTML File
```html
<!-- home.html - 587 lines -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    :root {
      /* 43 lines of repeated design tokens */
    }
    /* 400+ lines of component styles */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- 100+ lines of repeated header -->
  <!-- 200+ lines of main content -->
  <!-- 50+ lines of repeated bottom nav -->
  <script>
    /* 100+ lines of inline JavaScript */
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### After: Clean React Component
```jsx
// HomePage.jsx - ~50 lines
import React from 'react';
import PageLayout from '../layout/PageLayout';
import SessionCard from '../session/SessionCard';
import { useMeetList } from '../../hooks/useMeetList';

const HomePage = () => {
  const { meetListCount } = useMeetList();
  
  return (
    <PageLayout activeTab="home">
      <section className="welcome-section">
        <h1 className="welcome-title">Good morning, John</h1>
        <p className="welcome-subtitle">Here's what's happening at the conference today</p>
      </section>
      
      <section className="now-next-section">
        <h2 className="section-title">Now & Next</h2>
        <div className="cards-container">
          <SessionCard session={currentSession} variant="now" />
          <SessionCard session={nextSession} variant="next" />
        </div>
      </section>
    </PageLayout>
  );
};
```
