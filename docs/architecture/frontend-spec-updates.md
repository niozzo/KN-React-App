# Front-End Specification Updates

## Overview

This document outlines the specific updates needed for `docs/front-end-spec.md` to reflect the new React component architecture while maintaining the original UX goals and design principles.

## Required Updates

### 1. Technology Stack Section

#### Current (Outdated):
```markdown
## Technology Implementation
- HTML5 semantic markup
- CSS3 with custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactions
- Progressive Web App features
```

#### Updated:
```markdown
## Technology Implementation
- React 18 with TypeScript for component architecture
- CSS Custom Properties (design tokens) for consistent styling
- Custom React hooks for state management
- Progressive Web App features with service workers
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI library
```

### 2. Component Architecture Section (New)

Add new section after Information Architecture:

```markdown
## Component Architecture

### Design System
- **Design Tokens**: Centralized CSS custom properties for colors, typography, spacing
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components with consistent APIs
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with consistent breakpoints

### Core Components

#### Layout Components
- **PageLayout**: Consistent page structure with header and navigation
- **Header**: Logo, user info, and branding
- **BottomNav**: Tab-based navigation system

#### UI Components
- **Button**: Multi-variant button with consistent styling
- **Card**: Flexible container with hover states and variants
- **StatusTag**: Status indicators (Now/Next/Sponsor)
- **Form Components**: Input, Select, Toggle with consistent styling

#### Feature Components
- **SessionCard**: Session display with countdown and seat information
- **AttendeeCard**: Attendee listing with actions and shared events
- **Search Components**: Filtering and sorting functionality

### Custom Hooks
- **useMeetList**: Meet list state management and animations
- **useSearch**: Search and filtering functionality
- **useSort**: List sorting with multiple field support
- **useLazyImage**: Intersection Observer-based image lazy loading for bandwidth optimization
```

### 3. Implementation Examples Updates

#### Current (Mockup References):
```markdown
### Home Screen Implementation
- File: `mockups/home.html`
- Key features: Now/Next cards, countdown timers, seat assignments
```

#### Updated:
```markdown
### Home Screen Implementation
- Component: `HomePage.jsx` (80 lines vs 587 lines in original)
- Key features: SessionCard components, useMeetList hook, responsive design
- Architecture: PageLayout wrapper with reusable components
```

### 4. User Flow Updates

#### Current:
```markdown
### Meet List Management Flow
1. User navigates to meet list page
2. Searches and filters attendees
3. Adds attendees to personal meet list
4. Views shared events and networking hints
```

#### Updated:
```markdown
### Meet List Management Flow
1. User navigates to MeetPage component
2. Uses search functionality via useSearch hook
3. Adds attendees via useMeetList hook with animations
4. Views shared events through AttendeeCard component
```

### 5. Responsive Design Updates

#### Current:
```markdown
### Mobile-First Approach
- Breakpoints: 480px, 768px, 1024px
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized for iPhone usage patterns
```

#### Updated:
```markdown
### Mobile-First Approach
- Breakpoints: CSS custom properties (--breakpoint-sm, --breakpoint-md, --breakpoint-lg)
- Touch-friendly interactions with consistent button sizing
- Optimized for iPhone usage patterns
- Component-based responsive design with utility classes
```

### 6. Performance Considerations Updates

#### Current:
```markdown
### Performance Requirements
- Fast initial load (< 3 seconds)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Efficient memory usage
```

#### Updated:
```markdown
### Performance Requirements
- Fast initial load (< 3 seconds) with code splitting
- Smooth animations using CSS custom properties
- Efficient memory usage with React component optimization
- Reduced bundle size through shared component library
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Image lazy loading with Intersection Observer API (95% bandwidth reduction for MeetPage)
  - Preloads images 200px before entering viewport
  - Graceful fallback for older browsers
  - Progressive loading with shimmer effects
```

### 7. Accessibility Updates

#### Current:
```markdown
### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support
```

#### Updated:
```markdown
### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic HTML
- Screen reader compatibility through proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support in all components
- Focus management in React components
- High contrast mode support via CSS custom properties
```

## Specific File Updates Needed

### 1. Update Component References
Replace all references to:
- `mockups/home.html` → `HomePage.jsx`
- `mockups/meet.html` → `MeetPage.jsx`
- `mockups/schedule.html` → `SchedulePage.jsx`
- `mockups/sponsors.html` → `SponsorsPage.jsx`
- `mockups/settings.html` → `SettingsPage.jsx`

### 2. Update Implementation Details
- Replace HTML/CSS/JS examples with React component examples
- Update file structure references
- Add component API documentation
- Include hook usage examples

### 3. Add New Sections
- Component Architecture overview
- Design System documentation
- Custom Hooks documentation
- Migration considerations

### 4. Update Visual Design Section
- Reference design tokens instead of hardcoded values
- Update color system to use CSS custom properties
- Add component variant documentation
- Include responsive design patterns

## Validation Checklist
