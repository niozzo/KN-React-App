# Technical Spikes Recommendation

**Architect:** Winston 🏗️  
**Generated:** 2025-09-08  
**Purpose:** Identify areas requiring technical spikes for better understanding

## Spike Analysis

After reviewing the greenfield architecture, I've identified several areas that would benefit from technical spikes to validate assumptions and reduce implementation risk.

## 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY SPIKES** (Critical for success)

### 1. **Supabase RLS + Real-time Integration Spike**
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Why Spike Needed:** Complex interaction between RLS policies and real-time subscriptions

**Spike Goals:**
- Validate that real-time subscriptions work correctly with RLS policies
- Test performance of real-time updates with 200+ concurrent users
- Understand WebSocket connection limits and scaling
- Verify real-time data consistency across multiple clients

**Spike Scope:**
```typescript
// Test real-time seating updates with RLS
const testRealtimeRLS = async () => {
  // 1. Create test RLS policies
  // 2. Set up real-time subscription
  // 3. Test concurrent updates from multiple users
  // 4. Measure performance and connection stability
  // 5. Test error handling and reconnection logic
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Real-time updates work reliably with RLS
- Performance acceptable with 200+ concurrent users
- Connection stability and error handling robust
- Clear understanding of Supabase real-time limits

### 2. **Logo Fetching Service Integration Spike**
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Why Spike Needed:** External API dependencies and rate limiting

**Spike Goals:**
- Test Clearbit API reliability and rate limits
- Validate Logo.dev API integration
- Test favicon fetching across different domains
- Understand fallback strategies and error handling
- Measure performance impact on sponsor loading

**Spike Scope:**
```typescript
// Test logo fetching with real sponsor data
const testLogoFetching = async () => {
  // 1. Test Clearbit API with various domains
  // 2. Test Logo.dev API integration
  // 3. Test favicon fetching reliability
  // 4. Measure response times and success rates
  // 5. Test rate limiting and error handling
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Logo fetching works reliably for 90%+ of domains
- Performance acceptable (<2s per logo)
- Proper fallback strategies implemented
- Rate limiting handled gracefully

### 3. **Large Dataset Performance Spike**
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Why Spike Needed:** 222 attendees + complex relationships may cause performance issues

**Spike Goals:**
- Test performance with full dataset (222 attendees)
- Validate virtual scrolling for large lists
- Test complex queries with joins and filters
- Measure memory usage and bundle size impact
- Test mobile performance on lower-end devices

**Spike Scope:**
```typescript
// Test performance with realistic data volumes
const testLargeDatasetPerformance = async () => {
  // 1. Load 222 attendees with all relationships
  // 2. Test filtering and search performance
  // 3. Test virtual scrolling with large lists
  // 4. Measure memory usage and bundle size
  // 5. Test on various device types
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- App loads in <3s with full dataset
- Smooth scrolling and filtering performance
- Memory usage stays under 100MB
- Works well on mobile devices

## 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY SPIKES** (Important for optimization)

### 4. **PWA Offline Functionality Spike**
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Why Spike Needed:** Complex offline data synchronization

**Spike Goals:**
- Test offline data caching strategies
- Validate sync logic when coming back online
- Test conflict resolution for offline changes
- Understand IndexedDB limitations and performance
- Test service worker update mechanisms

**Spike Scope:**
```typescript
// Test offline functionality with realistic scenarios
const testOfflineFunctionality = async () => {
  // 1. Cache critical data offline
  // 2. Test offline data access
  // 3. Test sync when coming back online
  // 4. Test conflict resolution
  // 5. Test service worker updates
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Critical data accessible offline
- Sync works reliably when online
- Conflict resolution handles edge cases
- Service worker updates work smoothly

### 5. **Material-UI + Custom Theme Integration Spike**
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Why Spike Needed:** Complex theming requirements and component customization

**Spike Goals:**
- Test Material-UI v5 with custom theme
- Validate component customization capabilities
- Test responsive design across devices
- Understand bundle size impact
- Test accessibility compliance

**Spike Scope:**
```typescript
// Test Material-UI integration with custom requirements
const testMUIIntegration = async () => {
  // 1. Create custom theme
  // 2. Test component customization
  // 3. Test responsive design
  // 4. Measure bundle size impact
  // 5. Test accessibility features
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Custom theme works across all components
- Responsive design works on all devices
- Bundle size impact acceptable
- Accessibility compliance maintained

## 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY SPIKES** (Nice to have)

### 6. **Advanced Caching Strategies Spike**
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Why Spike Needed:** Optimize performance with complex caching

**Spike Goals:**
- Test multi-level caching strategies
- Validate cache invalidation logic
- Test cache performance under load
- Understand memory usage patterns
- Test cache persistence across sessions

### 7. **Analytics Integration Spike**
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Why Spike Needed:** Understand analytics impact on performance

**Spike Goals:**
- Test Sentry integration performance
- Validate Vercel Analytics setup
- Test custom event tracking
- Understand privacy compliance
- Measure analytics overhead

## Recommended Spike Execution Plan

### **Week 1: Critical Spikes**
1. **Supabase RLS + Real-time Integration** (3 days)
2. **Logo Fetching Service Integration** (2 days)

### **Week 2: Performance Validation**
3. **Large Dataset Performance** (3 days)
4. **PWA Offline Functionality** (2 days)

### **Week 3: Integration Testing**
5. **Material-UI Integration** (2 days)
6. **Advanced Caching** (2 days)
7. **Analytics Integration** (1 day)

## Spike Deliverables

Each spike should produce:

1. **Technical Documentation**
   - Findings and recommendations
   - Performance metrics
   - Error handling strategies
   - Configuration examples

2. **Proof of Concept Code**
   - Working examples
   - Test cases
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Error scenarios

3. **Architecture Updates**
   - Revised technical decisions
   - Updated implementation plans
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Performance optimizations

## Risk Mitigation

### **If Spikes Reveal Issues:**
1. **Supabase Real-time Issues**: Consider alternative real-time solutions
2. **Logo Fetching Problems**: Implement more robust fallback strategies
3. **Performance Issues**: Optimize data loading and caching strategies
4. **PWA Limitations**: Simplify offline functionality or remove features
5. **MUI Integration Problems**: Consider alternative UI libraries

### **Contingency Plans:**
- **Alternative Real-time**: Socket.io or custom WebSocket implementation
- **Alternative Logo Service**: Manual logo upload or different API providers
- **Performance Optimization**: Data pagination, lazy loading, or server-side filtering
- **Simplified PWA**: Basic offline support or remove PWA features
- **Alternative UI**: Chakra UI or custom component library

## Conclusion

These spikes will validate critical assumptions and reduce implementation risk. The high-priority spikes are essential for project success, while medium and low-priority spikes will optimize the user experience.

**Recommendation**: Execute the high-priority spikes before beginning full implementation to avoid costly architectural changes later.

*These spikes will ensure the architecture is robust and production-ready before full implementation begins.*
