# Documentation Cleanup & Update Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to review, update, and clean up all documentation to ensure consistency with the new React component architecture. The goal is to maintain accurate, relevant documentation while removing outdated files and conflicting information.

## Documentation Review Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Documentation Updates

#### 1.1 Front-End Specification (`docs/front-end-spec.md`)
**Current Status**: References HTML mockup files and outdated architecture
**Required Updates**:
- [ ] Update technology stack section to reference React components
- [ ] Replace mockup file references with component names
- [ ] Update implementation examples to use new component APIs
- [ ] Add section on design system and component library
- [ ] Update responsive design patterns to reference CSS custom properties

#### 1.2 Greenfield Architecture (`docs/architecture/greenfield-architecture.md`)
**Current Status**: High-level architecture without component details
**Required Updates**:
- [ ] Add detailed component architecture section
- [ ] Update frontend technology stack to include new components
- [ ] Add design system documentation
- [ ] Update file structure to reflect new organization
- [ ] Add component interaction diagrams

#### 1.3 Documentation Navigation (`docs/architecture/DOCUMENTATION-NAVIGATION.md`)
**Current Status**: May reference outdated file structure
**Required Updates**:
- [ ] Update file structure diagram
- [ ] Add new component documentation links
- [ ] Remove references to mockup files
- [ ] Add migration guide references

### Phase 2: User Stories Updates

#### 2.1 Story References (`docs/stories/`)
**Current Status**: Stories may reference mockup files or outdated implementation
**Required Updates**:
- [ ] Update story 2.1 (now-next-glance-card) to reference SessionCard component
- [ ] Update story 3.1 (attendee-search-discovery) to reference AttendeeCard and search hooks
- [ ] Update story 3.2 (meet-list-management) to reference useMeetList hook
- [ ] Update story 3.3 (overlap-hints-networking-intelligence) to reference shared events functionality
- [ ] Add acceptance criteria for component-based implementation

### Phase 3: File Cleanup & Removal

#### 3.1 Mockup Files (Keep as Historical Reference)
**Files to Keep**:
- `mockups/index.html` - Historical reference for navigation design
- `mockups/home.html` - Historical reference for home page design
- `mockups/meet.html` - Historical reference for meet list design
- `mockups/schedule.html` - Historical reference for schedule design
- `mockups/sponsors.html` - Historical reference for sponsors design
- `mockups/settings.html` - Historical reference for settings design
- `mockups/session-detail.html` - Historical reference for session detail design
- `mockups/attendee-profile.html` - Historical reference for attendee profile design
- `mockups/bio.html` - Historical reference for bio page design
- `mockups/seat-map.html` - Historical reference for seat map design

**Action**: Keep all mockup files as historical documentation - no cleanup needed

#### 3.2 Legacy Analysis Files
**Files to Review for Removal**:
- [ ] `docs/architecture/legacy/data-tables-understanding-assessment.md`
- [ ] `docs/architecture/legacy/database-analysis.json`
- [ ] `docs/architecture/legacy/database-structure-reference.md`
- [ ] `docs/architecture/legacy/entity-relationships-analysis.md`
- [ ] `docs/architecture/legacy/final-data-model-clarification.md`
- [ ] `docs/architecture/legacy/ui-driven-schema-analysis.md`

**Decision Criteria**: Keep if still relevant to current database schema, remove if superseded by `database-schema.md`

#### 3.3 Outdated Architecture Files
**Files to Review**:
- [ ] `docs/architecture/File-Structure-Analysis.md` - Update or remove
- [ ] `docs/architecture/File-Structure.md` - Update with new structure
- [ ] `docs/architecture/technical-spikes-recommendation.md` - Update status

### Phase 4: New Documentation Creation

#### 4.1 Component API Documentation
**Files to Create**:
- [ ] `docs/components/README.md` - Component library overview
- [ ] `docs/components/common-components.md` - Header, Button, Card, etc.
- [ ] `docs/components/session-components.md` - SessionCard, SessionList
- [ ] `docs/components/attendee-components.md` - AttendeeCard, AttendeeList
- [ ] `docs/hooks/README.md` - Custom hooks documentation
- [ ] `docs/design-system/README.md` - Design tokens and styling guide

#### 4.2 Migration Documentation
**Files to Create**:
- [ ] `docs/migration/README.md` - Migration overview
- [ ] `docs/migration/component-migration-guide.md` - Step-by-step migration
- [ ] `docs/migration/breaking-changes.md` - What changed and why
- [ ] `docs/migration/developer-checklist.md` - Pre/post migration tasks

#### 4.3 Updated Deployment Documentation
**Files to Update/Create**:
- [ ] Update `docs/spikes/vercel-database-spike/SPIKE-DEPLOYMENT.md`
- [ ] Create `docs/deployment/react-app-deployment.md`
- [ ] Update any build scripts documentation

### Phase 5: Documentation Validation

#### 5.1 Consistency Checks
- [ ] All file references are accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] No broken links between documents
- [ ] Component names match actual implementation
- [ ] API examples work with current code
- [ ] Architecture diagrams reflect current structure

#### 5.2 Completeness Review
- [ ] All new components are documented
- [ ] All hooks have usage examples
- [ ] Design system is fully documented
- [ ] Migration path is clear and complete
- [ ] Developer onboarding is covered

## Risk Mitigation

### Before Removing Files
- [ ] Ensure all important information is captured in new documentation
- [ ] Create backups of files being removed
- [ ] Verify no other documents reference the files being removed
- [ ] Get team approval for file removal

### During Updates
- [ ] Test all code examples in documentation
- [ ] Verify all links work correctly
- [ ] Ensure documentation matches actual implementation

### After Cleanup
- [ ] Conduct final review with development team
- [ ] Update any external references or bookmarks
- [ ] Communicate changes to all stakeholders
- [ ] Monitor for any issues or confusion

This comprehensive cleanup plan ensures that all documentation remains accurate, relevant, and helpful for developers working with the new React component architecture.
