# TDD Integration Template for Stories

## TDD Acceptance Criteria (Add to each story)
1. **Unit Tests**: All components and services have comprehensive unit tests with 80% line coverage
2. **Integration Tests**: User journeys and component interactions are tested with 70% branch coverage
3. **PWA Tests**: All PWA features (offline/online, A2HS, service worker) are properly tested
4. **Accessibility Tests**: All interactive elements have accessibility testing
5. **Test Documentation**: All tests follow Given-When-Then pattern and are well-documented

## TDD Tasks (Add to each story)
- [ ] Task X: Implement TDD for [Feature Name]
  - [ ] Write unit tests for components (80% line coverage)
  - [ ] Write integration tests for user flows (70% branch coverage)
  - [ ] Write PWA-specific tests for offline/online functionality
  - [ ] Write accessibility tests for interactive elements
  - [ ] Validate test coverage meets thresholds
  - [ ] Update test documentation

## Quality Gates (Add to each story)
- All tests must pass before story completion
- Coverage thresholds must be met (80% line, 85% function, 70% branch)
- PWA compliance must be validated
- Accessibility standards must be met
- No critical bugs in test suite

## PWA Testing Requirements (Add to each story)
- **Offline/Online State Testing**: Test component behavior in both states
- **Service Worker Testing**: Test caching and update strategies
- **A2HS Testing**: Test installation prompts and user flows
- **Cache Testing**: Test data persistence and retrieval
- **Network State Testing**: Test network failure scenarios
