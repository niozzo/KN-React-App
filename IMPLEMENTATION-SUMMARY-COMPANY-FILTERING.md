# Implementation Summary: Company Field Filtering for Specific Speakers

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Implementation Time**: ~1.5 hours  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready for Manual Verification

---

## Problem Statement

Two speakers were incorrectly assigned "Apax" as their company in the main database, but they don't actually have a company affiliation. The company name needed to be hidden across all application pages:
- Bio page detail view
- Bio search results
- Schedule/agenda speaker information
- Home page session displays

**Affected Attendee IDs**:
- `de8cb880-e6f5-425d-9267-1eb0a2817f6b`
- `21d75c80-9560-4e4c-86f0-9345ddb705a1`

---

## Solution Implemented

### Approach
Added a data transformation at the sync layer that clears the `company` field for specific attendee IDs. This ensures:
- ✅ Single point of transformation
- ✅ Filtered data flows through all caching layers
- ✅ Consistent display across all components
- ✅ Easy to extend if more cases arise

### Architecture Decision
The transformation was placed in `ServerDataSyncService.applyTransformations()` because:
1. This method already handles data transformations for other tables
2. Transformation happens before caching, so filtered data propagates everywhere
3. No need to modify multiple display components
4. Maintains separation of concerns

---

## Files Modified

### `src/services/serverDataSyncService.ts`
**Location**: Lines 75-92 (inserted after agenda items transformation)

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Attendees transformation - filter company for specific edge cases
if (tableName === 'attendees') {
  // Edge case: These speakers were assigned "Apax" in the main DB but 
  // don't have a company affiliation. Clear company to prevent display.
  const ATTENDEES_WITHOUT_COMPANY = [
    'de8cb880-e6f5-425d-9267-1eb0a2817f6b',
    '21d75c80-9560-4e4c-86f0-9345ddb705a1'
  ];
  
  records = records.map(attendee => {
    if (ATTENDEES_WITHOUT_COMPANY.includes(attendee.id)) {
      return { ...attendee, company: '' };
    }
    return attendee;
  });
  
  console.log(`🔧 Cleared company field for ${ATTENDEES_WITHOUT_COMPANY.length} attendees without company affiliation`);
}
```

## Files Created

### 1. `src/__tests__/services/serverDataSyncService.test.ts`
**Purpose**: Unit tests for company filtering transformation

**Coverage**: 9 test cases
- ✅ Clears company for attendee de8cb880-e6f5-425d-9267-1eb0a2817f6b
- ✅ Clears company for attendee 21d75c80-9560-4e4c-86f0-9345ddb705a1
- ✅ Preserves company for other attendees
- ✅ Handles attendees with already empty company
- ✅ Handles attendees with null company
- ✅ Doesn't fail if excluded attendee ID is not in dataset
- ✅ Preserves all other attendee fields unchanged
- ✅ Handles mixed dataset with both excluded and regular attendees
- ✅ Doesn't affect other table transformations

**Test Results**: ✅ 9/9 passing

### 2. `src/__tests__/services/serverDataSyncService.integration.test.ts`
**Purpose**: Integration tests for complete data flow (sync → cache → retrieval)

**Coverage**: 6 test cases
- ✅ Filters company through complete data flow
- ✅ Maintains data integrity through AttendeeCacheFilterService
- ✅ Handles empty attendees array gracefully
- ✅ Doesn't affect non-attendee table data flow
- ✅ Handles attendee with undefined company field
- ✅ Handles large dataset efficiently (100 records < 100ms)

**Test Results**: ✅ 6/6 passing

**Note**: Mocked `AttendeeCacheFilterService` to avoid database calls during tests

### 3. `MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
**Purpose**: Structured checklist for manual QA verification

**Contents**: 
- Prerequisites and setup steps
- 4 test cases with Given-When-Then format
- Cross-browser testing checklist
- Rollback plan
- Sign-off section

## Test Results Summary

| Test Suite | Tests | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Unit Tests | 9 | ✅ All Passing |
| Integration Tests | 6 | ✅ All Passing |
| **Total** | **15** | **✅ All Passing** |

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. **Sync**: Data fetched from Supabase
2. **Transform**: `applyTransformations()` clears company field for specific IDs
3. **Cache**: Filtered data stored in localStorage via `cacheTableData()`
4. **Filter**: `AttendeeCacheFilterService` removes confidential fields
5. **Retrieve**: Components get filtered data via `getCachedTableData()`
6. **Display**: UI components render with empty company field

### Type Safety
- Uses empty string (`''`) instead of `null` to maintain type consistency
- Existing display logic already handles falsy values: `{attendee.company && ...}`

### Performance
- Transformation is O(n) where n = number of attendees
- Array.includes() lookup is O(1) for 2 IDs
- Large dataset test (100 attendees) completes in < 100ms

---

## Deployment Notes

### Cache Invalidation
⚠️ **Important**: Users must re-login or clear cache to see these changes

**Why**: The transformation happens at sync time. Existing cached data won't be updated automatically.

**Options**:
1. Users can clear browser cache and re-login
2. Alternatively, clear localStorage key `kn_cache_attendees`
3. Consider cache versioning in future if this becomes frequent

### Rollback Procedure
If issues are discovered:
1. Remove lines 75-92 in `src/services/serverDataSyncService.ts`
2. Deploy updated code
3. Users clear cache and re-login

---

## Future Considerations

### If This List Grows (>5 attendees)
Consider moving to application database with an `attendee_preferences` table:
- Add `hide_company` boolean flag
- Query preferences during sync
- More maintainable than hardcoded IDs

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Display-layer filtering**: Would require changes in 4+ components (rejected: error-prone)
2. **Configuration file**: Adds complexity without benefit for static list (rejected: over-engineering)
3. **Application DB flag**: More flexible but over-engineered for 2 attendees (deferred)
